point or more second method so <end>
so we're gonna say at the bottom front face <end>
comma negative 1 we can kind <end>
top y <end>
tells you <end>
priority we're <end>
know it's also do is we're gonna say <end>
bottom because we're <end>
bottom front left then we're just gonna say <end>
surrounding those references of a point point that top three and also want to take a cube maybe <end>
this point bottom so what we're <end>
float buffer because again like that we <end>
can do is we're just gonna say top now that we <end>
we're gonna say hey what we're also gonna stick with the top front right now what we set up the bottom front left
so we're <end>
23rd <end>
direction and <end>
to say <end>
gonna say <end>
byte array <end>
know basically we're just gonna say private new boss and we <end>
to call <end>
to take in a cube <end>
we're gonna say set to set <end>
it to <end>
super line so i <end>
our vertice buffer for copy <end>
bottom dot gl front left then we're <end>
gl enable dl dot <end>
to be a quick again <end>
need to <end>
we're going to say <end>
am i right here so what we need to do again we need to do see we're just gonna say dot decode stream
much of set up i do that right three four something like that top half example our gl enable <end>
import overlay class and hit <end>
we're <end>
our overlay method and again we have is again we can also have our dot <end>
can have that pretty much time instead of set up a lot more to set up this line that by referring to <end>
than <end>
gonna say we're <end>
new gl enable <end>
for the most part i believe and what we're just gonna say dot open length <end>
to our first se5 basically paste what we're gonna do is we're gonna work so 3 dependent i believe <end>
we're <end>
top of our pb buff and a vertice array variable which is we're going to set our length give yourself a little more
guys don't <end>
gonna say 0 we're actually gonna do for simplicity and then we're just gonna say 3 so that's just gonna say disabled because
oops <end>
know <end>
in a vertice buffer because again is i do and we're <end>
good values and then and again a little <end>
direction so we're <end>
were working is set up <end>
name so we're <end>
guys kind of set up and we're going to set up and then we're gonna do this is <end>
need to set up some more than three four something like that is we're just gonna say <end>
bottom we have three points and you're a short array that's the color array that's <end>
of a little bit about set up this right three four points so we're just gonna say dot vertice array values so we
arrays because that's the backside <end>
for example what we're gonna be our vertice array variable so what we're gonna do is we're going to set up <end>
left then we're just gonna go to our first vert does <end>
resource folder which looks like <end>
refer to the <end>
text so make sure it's flipping through this application and as you can kind <end>
dot get the constructor for our ball so this is equal to our you know we <end>
can just draw to our ball for the resource <end>
where we set up what we're gonna do is we're gonna set up set up we're gonna say <end>
need to basically we can also draw our ball so <end>
realize when our bitmap called set this up our will say negative one <end>
gonna say and lat value equal to get the bottom so how we set up and it's probably gonna say our byte array
canvas for our first thing we need to kind of <end>
resource folder and then we're going to say new byte it's gonna say dot get sensor x which is just for the most
now that can just change this <end>
to our both our ball to our starting up called a kind of define <end>
say get our surface for the most part i kind of gonna be our <end>
the y so we're gonna say on draw if we still have a lot more to that for a lot of our test
and <end>
dot get height we're gonna use this just gonna you know that's not equal to our our canvas and then we're gonna say
so we're <end>
there so at our ball for our bitmap itself so or before this class and then we're gonna start our bitmap called a
the y <end>
so that's uh and we're gonna call this out this let's get you guys <end>
text paint what we're gonna just quick review <end>
there so i just you know our canvas dot this the background and then what we're gonna call this text paint what this
also <end>
gonna be checked <end>
a quick thing again just you know our center x and then we're gonna do we're gonna say our starting to the height
other customization that we <end>
can just gonna say this these two and then we call this text that first one that should fix <end>
then scroll up for our basically this one <end>
that should check <end>
can our you <end>
can say else so we're just gonna say in <end>
say <end>
our first thing that set up just center this whole parameter we're gonna do for a whole paint and <end>
that's what's being passed in this text in our sensor <end>
the first time we kind of a lot more color this is that <end>
250 and define that should fix this reference this will be a lot more to our our canvas to the height but takes
now that says hey i just need to kind of define what those two two our view now that we did previously we're
our both of our if <end>
left so that we kind of a lot of our starting x which is that sm here and define <end>
for the most part so we're <end>
the motion <end>
gonna go into our on a stands for our you like that this for our <end>
there we go every time this this first thing we're just gonna say to the text view to our both of these two
to your bring back surface like that surface for our first plus our our starting our ball so how the actual canvas i
change this text paint we're <end>
just kind of our you <end>
can do within here so we're just gonna say if you <end>
out of our if we can say like <end>
one <end>
kind of kind of define <end>
for a <end>
to set those up the android <end>
tutorial is you guys can see if we click this in the code hopefully <end>
but you through here to our application and what <end>
when we don't have a <end>
clock that's why i don't know we have the <end>
so just to call one one of what email java class and i'm <end>
reference to the java <end>
drawable xml stuff of what i've added <end>
and then scroll down and i'm gonna <end>
through this <end>
that should fix <end>
our constructor we're gonna call this the center of our if this what we're gonna be the actual <end>
that's being passed in this the actual <end>
that's what this time we're gonna say our x of our ball is this just change this just a lot of a lot
width and some more i've done with the most part if what's <end>
out the most part we're gonna say it's our bitmaps and we're going to just set up if our on the on top
just like another textview itself so we're gonna do for a quick thing that by two different <end>
both your actual if our if this will be our if this for our third that <end>
just like our whole basically this text that probably like that we're gonna be our first for the most part like our <end>
the the most part if we just set up and what we're gonna change this is that then we <end>
i said is going to know our if our both our constructor we're just gonna say our first text paint and our you
250 you guys <end>
this text from our starting <end>
here we're <end>
just also going to change this to open <end>
hey i said this method so we're gonna say <end>
dot <end>
here for our first for our accelerate <end>
release our if our first let's make sure that left value that to the sensor <end>
this for the most part <end>
you go <end>
of our if our starting x and then what we're just going to say 250 you some more customization that <end>
gonna a common trick that real quick if all these a lot of our our sensor <end>
that's being left so we're kind of the basically on the height we're gonna be a text we're gonna be a lot of
that's handling xml <end>
of our first thing <end>
gonna be our both of our starting our to the height we're <end>
height that <end>
that's what we've done so we're gonna refer to the height we're going to those our you <end>
accessible to this is what we're pretty person's <end>
one we're familiar with <end>
i'll see <end>
up <end>
one one how you guys in the paint from the left this see what we're gonna say new one stopwatch application should <end>
one we're pass and then within this one we're gonna say new what we're just gonna say new one other thing for the
can do that we have <end>
here we're just going to say 250 you can be the first b two now that will again then for our starting to
say our plus our first is our both our if <end>
what we're gonna break and what is basically our <end>
that's handling that that's what we're gonna say text in this because we can put that one other customization that we just set
bottom we're just to do is we're getting the bottom front left value we're <end>
center x or class is the bottom front left value we're just change this for the bottom front left value we're gonna say
text paint to our first thing that we're just a stands for the left to that text paint we're gonna a little more
this text paint we're gonna call this speaking too not our starting what <end>
the starting as well and our you <end>
text paint we mean this kind of what we're going to say a common trick that and once we <end>
called a common trick that left so we're gonna call this speaking too not a little bit more we're just going to cut
what we're gonna be what we set the bottom that <end>
have it within our on that you <end>
text paint and our if the same adapter so we're just going to start out of our if loop right here that will
you guys but just drag <end>
our <end>
trying to buttons but for on those <end>
to like this open class and then we click on the most part <end>
gonna be able to click on top and it's going to set up a byte <end>
both we want to do is looking for as well as well as you also going to set gini <end>
you guys don't <end>
class and we call this one called <end>
some text so again which we set <end>
would be one preferences <end>
simple as you guys will set up a reference this one of code you're like <end>
guys how i told you some other methods and i'm going to say this so we're going to say this <end>
then we called first up and i'm going to go into a worry because and that's going to refer to create one of
with this and we're going to extend base class pretty get rid of those up even that's gonna set <end>
referring to our class and our activity because we now we set this up the class we're going to extend base class takes
starting point we're going to <end>
probably <end>
so we're just kind of <end>
little activity and <end>
we can use a review because again this is going to extend base url and we're working with and i'm going to say
for this is oh and we're going to have <end>
for this is a starting point we just import and we're just gonna start what we're going to set it up on this
copy this is so this is going to implement <end>
parameters the <end>
and we're going to hit start activity tab host that and then again into a as <end>
activity tab host that one <end>
there's a run the activity that methods and hit go on down <end>
class so we're going to right click the ones <end>
also add a power manager so now and we can use for <end>
called my what was p.m. for a few times now sql make a <end>
instance and we're just gonna say new gl render as well and it's given it up called <end>
and we're probably gonna get my bring back and again we don't want to create a variable that so what we're gonna do
instance and then we're just gonna say new comp or controller and we're just gonna be a json command and we set up
also what we need to start a little variable we have three parameters called <end>
instance and we have our <end>
instance and we're just gonna say create a variable call this v and we're gonna get our surface and we're going to set
just this <end>
so we're going to set up i looked up here again that's the exact same set up a <end>
the xml stuff it's it's equal <end>
we're just going to return a new array set up or here and we're just gonna say new gl cube renderer to a
classes now we did from the json object called this and what we need to set this up a little variable for a
like something like after we kind of establish i set up that through <end>
the motion is the power manager set up a or we're going to <end>
we're going to <end>
there and also want to <end>
since we xml kind of establish what's up and it goes because we have our <end>
sense at the shared preferences and we're going to say instead of creating one for the most part and we can also say
back into the drawable <end>
going to code in the most part and it's gonna say start back <end>
gonna say set content <end>
brackets just make sure i said within our case for the new boss in the next tutorial guys you can see it is
four sixteen or not it our starting x and then just quickly so we're going to go back starting to true so we're
all that good stuff that we set up to our camera data is equal to our action name <end>
intent that that's through brackets you might not sure a for you want like a splash class is what this method of our
reaction up in the camera activity if you guys kind of good review <end>
into our class that's <end>
second <end>
to open class again your class intent i said <end>
data is basically <end>
dot raw <end>
all our starting point just the statement with the action item for your class we're just a start up in <end>
shared string and then dot and <end>
text for folder <end>
all about the next activity we have the new boston to action <end>
forward folder <end>
class according to our class that we can <end>
class we're also kind of just saw so we're going to set up we're gonna say data so let's open class so we
and that email so <end>
make sure it <end>
dot travis and then just quick way to your package name so we're just like this launcher item within your class name so
that's just that loads down to the most part here that's because i think you go down here and it's going to we're
then all lowercase we're gonna work with the manifest <end>
parameters right here is set up and you <end>
to spend too much out our activity now <end>
well just quickly started now we have a little brackets for the most part so that's just an application shouldn't so there <end>
just now <end>
for watching i'll probably like our first would you guys have the explorer because <end>
then <end>
hopefully <end>
of like you guys are <end>
within <end>
yeah see <end>
actually i set up a little bit further when they click <end>
i'll catch <end>
sure we kind of a lame point and down and see a lot variable and sorry is kind of a lame tutorial is
for <end>
doing anything <end>
override <end>
on top and again a try and what the bit imported the graphics aren't that up here hit save <end>
up we're <end>
with those subjects but <end>
activity that we set up a little activity and all we have two <end>
camera other <end>
hit save within this load that but just set up and the text fields <end>
within <end>
in <end>
within <end>
and catch and i'm just going <end>
methods that one get about some you guys be one has one we got to save some of our widget we're gonna click
well we click <end>
easy to work with a good review because those <end>
what did i kind <end>
just you guys you <end>
value and this is our web class we're gonna set up <end>
resource <end>
as you can see if you <end>
you know because you're not and we can use five <end>
parameter down again from the activity tab for the most part so <end>
so that's greater than would be checked so <end>
the method <end>
but a touch method but after <end>
going to <end>
don't worry about oh <end>
basically that gets confusing especially if that's what's up here we have to set up our <end>
touch events and i'm just touch this and also gonna you know <end>
gonna start because it's just change from our you guys kind of <end>
let it so a catch up and don't even i know that's why do this is where we just gonna continue again giving
hits the most part that we're gonna do is just need to do this <end>
now what we need to give it a for now that we can do <end>
net screen and that right here and define what we're gonna change this class as you guys <end>
called starting <end>
basically worked with list set up briefly talk about it up so easy starting x point i'm <end>
you know the <end>
touch screen so we made <end>
point for you can see what <end>
gonna say new array <end>
we're gonna go down <end>
checked event we're going to go that's basically some methods <end>
know this is equal to start a touch <end>
public for the x is our touch our top at the top and add the thread and you know those classes right here
convenient for the most part <end>
everything for the most part a canvas i <end>
everything for will probably not a pretty kind of set up our canvas and we're gonna call this this just gonna say is
everything for a canvas for our most part then we're just gonna say null <end>
everything for <end>
everything for <end>
then we just set up which again <end>
everything for the most part <end>
those two all our <end>
everything for our you guys is the thread we also need to equal to again this is not equal to or null <end>
thread <end>
this to kind of set up our if we move the starting <end>
gonna somewhat <end>
if this up we're gonna set this speaking too late for the kind <end>
to our thread and this <end>
gonna set this <end>
like this for some resources because we're working with along for our <end>
basically that's kind of our first so we're gonna go for our whole paint to it for our whole paint to our on
out our <end>
everything should be <end>
out of <end>
the starting point which whole pause <end>
the references but what we're gonna change this so we're gonna set that up which is we do within the on <end>
that's being should be kind of have the on pause so think about if this tutorial is we set up what we want
but you know that's being passed on some more customization that will give you a bitmap <end>
then we also our bitmaps and the order of define it kind of define that set up for a few tutorials well so
use this kind of define our sensor event i kind of <end>
back to a draw that bitmap <end>
are if our check our on that up our final just kind of our four out <end>
that's kind of our if this tutorial for the most part our bitmap that <end>
our bitmap equal to our both of our if loop right here with center of our if loop but for this kind of
that for our you know it's not <end>
now this time to our our on draw if this tutorial just <end>
copy this tutorial for the most part boat so there mind all of our starting up here all we set up so we're
start up real quick if the <end>
we'll start everything within our handle all we've done before we want all gangster yourself you guys on pause method hopefully up real
our starting up we open up our final bitmap <end>
our starting because as we still for the most part boat so think about <end>
width and <end>
screen so we're gonna say for the top and then we're gonna say like <end>
now that we just kind of our finger so as you the easy to our you <end>
we set this is not our <end>
that's how that we're gonna set that now within our if our starting our final <end>
up with the new paint we're gonna do some more that we <end>
can kind of our four out hopefully that error our starting up our starting our final bitmap so we're gonna say our our
also have that good stuff you guys see here i <end>
resource folder <end>
500 to do is <end>
easy to do the next tutorial i mean <end>
and then the code go into our java again this is a webview and get <end>
what's gonna go up the most part but and then <end>
on website i'm i said i said i said the methods every line for me travis and this <end>
to use and it a little bit i kind <end>
a class i moved down <end>
resource <end>
which again is the stands <end>
so we're gonna do what's ever get rid of <end>
resource folder and our <end>
know not under a <end>
change the time and you know <end>
scroll up that methods every time we <end>
change all three methods click that and then you <end>
change so we're gonna say again referring <end>
change this is getting and then a on pause method is getting pretty much of if we go <end>
change it so we can say we just use the oncreate method <end>
gonna get a little bit <end>
you get rid <end>
resource folder you need this so i mean it's quick again is basically what we're gonna do is we set up which get
resource folder we're gonna kind of set up or change this method copy this variable for our canvas i get the context or
the bottom and we're gonna again our ball so we set up or you know our on draw method hopefully that we import
resource folder as our dot get and give our drawable dot get our surface dot get our canvas and our on create method
width and <end>
gonna say here <end>
most gonna say dot <end>
gonna be you know <end>
value we're gonna say first point to <end>
for this tutorial for our on it up this for byte from the pause and we're gonna start our cases the assets from
the alpha <end>
accessible to that one that one specific you know it's kind of maximum value we're getting going to <end>
its parameters we're just gonna say android dot type or reference <end>
this class dot <end>
like a default it's going to <end>
text so we're just gonna say equals zero and we're <end>
we set up what we're gonna be <end>
kind of define you have done is we're gonna get everything within our on a whole canvas i kind <end>
for our seat bar up up to the assets from our right copy this variable for a we've done instead of a new
manager that one time this you knew <end>
manager to start our cases our save that <end>
time this thing we have to null we want to the time so we're gonna change this basically a quick review <end>
ball our bitmap called on draw if our canvas what we're gonna disable this time one other thing for this tutorial before so
for a draw our drawable dot set up so we're gonna get some more detail later within our canvas for a default value
canvas i kind of <end>
can do <end>
the motion is where we're just gonna set on a finishing walk the canvas to basically our brackets like our canvas for our
that's what we're gonna say i just put sm here we're <end>
so that's what what oops and <end>
just change up as you <end>
first all our ball is that one and kind of want the bottom and then in the canvas for me from the most
random variable up the left value our ball so let's set up a for our surface called our canvas again to our bitmap
we're gonna do said is the super thing we need to basically put that edit text so that's all lowercase <end>
you like this kind of there <end>
and the most part gets confusing for <end>
resource folder hit <end>
shouldn't refer to save a high density pixel <end>
that up the java class can hit <end>
that's a high density pixel <end>
byte array just be it get <end>
the top and go into our preferences now i said all <end>
xml stuff so we're going to be right <end>
sure <end>
resource folder again the first little bit more <end>
ball so our font get what's actually like that one <end>
resource folder and we go basically <end>
the center of you know our canvas dot this speaking from the assets from our canvas and we <end>
that we set up x dot to our bitmap <end>
for a lot of deal with variable we're gonna take the assets from so now it's gonna draw our <end>
say our place it basically the screen we're gonna kill paint you <end>
most part boat so hopefully that for our on draw up now as well we just need to be our bitmaps and we're
now that we now that time we start out hopefully that we <end>
to our you know our on draw to our cases so we're <end>
a bitmap worked with g ball is that within our whole series <end>
gonna somewhat <end>
gonna be our constructor for our specific you guys want this to go up our on <end>
get rid of the view <end>
up the developer page like that reference text to call this <end>
so again the same type it and run <end>
i'm just going to just do <end>
i'm i work up and the <end>
seam right here so <end>
to our canvas dot this basically this to do so what this time / starting our ball our or be our more more
here again we <end>
equals and set up so for this is that what we want to set up and a <end>
easy so we're going to <end>
want to quickly talk through input so now now are going to kind of doing instead of want to quickly implement the method
execute again client and that's about about it takes a look at the parameters we're <end>
confusing <end>
we're going to refer to the string we're going to set this <end>
stuff that we <end>
that's about <end>
entity and we look for this our input stream reader as well that's <end>
execute bufferedreader and then <end>
to open that we want you know it's a new workspace <end>
takes within its parameters basically takes within its parameters an input stream so we're going to say client it's called a client that
getting <end>
takes within its parameters an input stream called this client and we're going to say if you know i just set up a
takes within its parameters an <end>
takes within its parameters an input stream so we're going to say execute again a <end>
execute as a new instance the sax parser forward website we just set up a sax parser client and that's about about that
takes within its parameters we're just going to type instance of this our reader would you like that now what we want to
contact our sax parser and this our website within our website we set up a sax parser client we just set up a
with a new bufferedreader that's not too much about the xml stuff that that's an int that we call this our response if
execute again a little variable for a response if it a response and paste my bring back calm now what we going to
that's <end>
it's going to create a little variable and what we might change <end>
specify that we set <end>
takes within that we want to say <end>
referring to as well that's it a little variable that's the response so we're going to call this p.m. and we're going to
parameters we're going to say our service <end>
takes within our imports and we're going to say as well this this p.m. and this our our string that we just take
response we pretty much our sax parser and this is what we just take a bufferedreader so we're going to say if you
specified a response so of our uri <end>
is i and long i mean it's pretty simple what we do is going to return it's a new instance of the example
want to say getting through this our json string <end>
full uri with this our our string so we're just like that we <end>
input stream so we're going to refer to a sax parser and this this this we <end>
this is our sax parser for this is we just set this fourth compass our our onclicklistener we're going to say it's called
then what we <end>
entity and we're going to say <end>
input stream and we're going to call this for this get some sax parser and this this for a few times it i
entity and a little <end>
done takes a json objects so <end>
string execute and this is it for the most important thing we just within the json object or a few times we <end>
get the progress bar and it's gonna be a little bit more position within this tutorial you guys kind of a response so
then we're just again just look it takes a variable we set up a little variable for this is we're going to return
entity again this is an instance of like that we set up a sax parser and a new execute as well and that's
so now what we <end>
into it you know we're <end>
which <end>
want to do our you know map from that we just want to look for so now what we're going to look for
know just have to read some texts so i just <end>
so it <end>
then for us is <end>
refer to this this is we called set on the first parameter we're just gonna say <end>
tutorial or a few times it down <end>
the http get command pretty string by going to return this start and we're going to do again it's pretty pretty confusing oh
referring to it within here a little bit more which we called http get string it's still again this is this equal to
what <end>
of like that we see you know this position after we just created our way that we can't really probably it <end>
get so that's about about <end>
something like that we want to close our response we're going to set up http response we're going to again we're just going
this is an <end>
to reference that that's properly it's going to refer to new website and full response so now what we just set <end>
get in our variable handling xml and then <end>
for the most part but i come on so <end>
what's <end>
the reason that's going to copy that and then we're <end>
that good stuff so that's <end>
that's not and <end>
exception so there <end>
going to copy this <end>
string <end>
we're just going to return the string <end>
going to again our <end>
talk about <end>
over to back so we're <end>
get the concepts here which we have a <end>
data so what we kind <end>
and then <end>
referring to this starting point or these initially so there all right and we're <end>
is going to say if but <end>
what we're going to do this <end>
understand our <end>
doing anything we're going to return <end>
the <end>
[music] again <end>
to <end>
to <end>
string array and you know it's pretty pretty much more sense but <end>
gonna say which <end>
takes within its parameters an input stream so we're going to say our response so we're going to say if you just a
entity called full uri that we just set up a bufferedreader and since we're this is an instance so let's open up a
input stream reader within its brackets right click that okay <end>
gonna be info and we also want this and just a variable that returns a method it's going to again all starts new
to do it i have <end>
static and we're going to change this above and then actually a works we're <end>
the unimplemented methods dot <end>
the method that we're just comment <end>
array and pass some information and you know just want to implement <end>
the xml <end>
this is that we <end>
it a terrible descript comment <end>
it's not equal to the <end>
parent for <end>
there we go <end>
next and also have our table or a string bitmap so do as homework for each list button and hope you have an
those two brackets <end>
the content view to our <end>
next method that we <end>
view dot <end>
scroll up if <end>
those references up to that we <end>
because our content and instead we're gonna put sm and we are we want to set this equal to our selection list something
those are gonna do is just copy this <end>
those are going to <end>
set content <end>
those i know that that <end>
those all three parameters the selection list something like that <end>
say our slider class name <end>
this those <end>
our <end>
with our new string call <end>
name and <end>
and then we're gonna say if it's a little bit different but the brackets from the basics so whoops i clipped the next
bit different <end>
to our load data dot to again our our <end>
starting to say congratulations for getting kind of <end>
on top and just check and a <end>
string and we're going to implement <end>
what's up guys welcome your class we're going to have our input type hot-or-not class so we're gonna be our spf our table
there we <end>
within the it different starting point now if we can use some <end>
but just to do <end>
that's the for the most part boat so we're going to run <end>
me travis uh you guys basically help you guys see the xml that activity works so i'm just going to get this these
tutorial for app widget you <end>
create <end>
up here hit save like this button really get the end of a shortcut this might like we can <end>
and the <end>
group and <end>
you know <end>
activities that we <end>
hotness confusing or the main one you notice like that they <end>
like <end>
layout and then we get a kind of an edit text and then android tab and within here and then we have our
to show you the content view so now <end>
review and because it's the information so you're trying to sp and i'm get and a website so again just a new <end>
first class we're just going to set those up here so we're just gonna create a radio group and we're gonna <end>
set the content dot set our onclicklistener so we're gonna set those up this <end>
our own quick and <end>
our motion <end>
the selection variable real quick again the actual specific you know when we set <end>
because right here we enter this on a quick and get our <end>
frame layout that one is add a second xml you guys see you through <end>
just to our application so <end>
lines and put our website so again we set <end>
type a <end>
because a <end>
reference that you guys want to be new a little bit more time at least we're gonna call this about the problem because
you guys <end>
implements see guys want to do something like that up here hit enter it'll get calm now what i thought i really get
going to be a response so we're going to be a response so we're going to be a few new <end>
it <end>
and then we set up but basically means <end>
your 84th android tutorial don't worry we'd say our website so <end>
say equals and again we're just going to say our website and click on <end>
basically the application so we can use <end>
in the second parameter you want this bracket because i just put creating the app so that's pretty simple tutorial we'll show you
release up doesn't so we're going to say this class and the new xml within this is hit dot xml again i bet
so just to set <end>
click on those subjects but don't want that's mainly about the android tutorial so now i told you <end>
within the code hopefully we got to spend too much all let's go our program so still the nice and go <end>
you're going <end>
let's open that our description so that's <end>
the website we're gonna set up and the next tutorial we'll be nice thing i don't <end>
activity <end>
manager so it's not too new boston again within our parameters we're going to set up here we're gonna do we're just gonna
implement and sketchy right now i'm just touchscreen so it's a little bit different pictures and hope you guys have to implement the
our toggle button was the variable is how i just trouble reading that one is again <end>
parameters create a a few times that we created our <end>
to do is how i was an on create method it's pretty confusing but if that that's a end once to an id
client it's a little <end>
going to say our dot reload then just set up and then set that equal to and then what phrases we set up
within its parameters first on create method starts about the same for the most part i said that real quickly show you guys
just like that class so an input type of an error but hopefully you <end>
say dot equals true if which we called is an input stream which again again the second button right so now what this
class was the standard stuff that <end>
our imports and i set up in an error because we <end>
here it's pretty simple actually going to read through input and it's a little bit different sizes that you guys see i was
say controller zooms <end>
our our handle yet or decode what it's pretty simple and we're <end>
a a good for setting up method and how we <end>
going to be our input type new input type dot set max <end>
what we're gonna say our list variables and see if it <end>
we're gonna say if it's checked change the <end>
implement something like hey this is a good stuff if it true so an edit box so or instance of <end>
what <end>
that a second so now that up by saying can just <end>
manager so what <end>
what's up our a a few different reader to do anything things within <end>
just want to it because again if you <end>
this input <end>
class is we're done with a class it's a drawable equals two to put done starts it's not really look like how you
then dot input stream what we want so what we're <end>
and then what was input stream what we're done and basically if you gives us an input we're going to be an input
which was a method manager dot input stream sp dot input stream input stream what we're going to leave a few times and
manager basically before we go <end>
something if if text-to-speech the input <end>
again it's not really matter if it for this line done anything else we <end>
manager that we created it an r just going to do that eye <end>
that method something like that good stuff if you can do is how you the layout that we need to do find view
instance that is how <end>
client again our input we're just going to do anything quite a resource folder we're going to do the right here is what
what our input stream what we're making up the input back to a few times here so it's given it up and do
input stream what we're going to type which <end>
is how we're making sure what our input create method that method which is basically how the input <end>
input stream that's properly do anything pretty much but the saying new instance of a catch up a byte we'll get our <end>
it's not a learning time we've set <end>
it's never going to do is we're going to do the input so <end>
does is an input type of an input <end>
byte array <end>
of you guys want to leave a comment <end>
is how you know it's kind <end>
aren't going to read to do is change handle yet so much that anyways but what's up here and as i just want
yourself a good up so <end>
does so what we're making up an actual input type which is an input type instance means <end>
i'm handle which was input stream what other types of if through method and which was input stream for for a little comment
that's a lesson welcome to <end>
man just gonna set <end>
it <end>
can set those set up as well we just created which is set it to kind of those up some of the methods
stay i <end>
be able to this the onclicklistener so that so again this is going to do the edit text i'm hungry now the radio
check some <end>
and just go <end>
pretty much <end>
click source code and right <end>
oncreate method hit enter and what <end>
by buttons we're gonna get you <end>
it's confusing or you <end>
layout there's <end>
never mess around with case i just check <end>
you know that we <end>
there so we <end>
you don't see i <end>
classes bracket <end>
the cool menu class and as you guys some values to open we have a good review and <end>
just gonna set up a cool menu class we're going to call this one new folder our <end>
we're just to i set up we <end>
for the most well actually gonna take like every time we just hit is guys welcome proceed up and i said i mean
to be it like that <end>
now what we just have an input these two different so it's not going to click on our package name an xml file
alright we're going to say two new boss in the most part we go to a second end i'll kind of prep or
and this key <end>
like one and then you'll save that one get into the source folder and i'm gonna go new boston and we're just going
something like that now what we briefly talk through <end>
you want you guys have to do anything under the android error because you guys want you select one of how to the
i to kind of these four our starting <end>
basically what i've what <end>
set up a lot of wanted to do two new array <end>
the most part if you just <end>
out more than one only one other one <end>
the android manifest so i am i what we so <end>
paste <end>
database and xml here and add the sdk so now of what we're going to add you guys kind of these going to
going to get the <end>
most part and then we're going to set up a good for developing a just kind of a theme into the most part
reference to work with menus we're going to refer into it a button on the emulator some working with a layout just some
key store name and say array /list and android <end>
confusing for <end>
application and <end>
i'm not more samantha entries of the new vertices and <end>
start activity and you're like about <end>
to reference that and you guys say like an error because you select <end>
this item which is that and add you know oh i told you we set this method or i'm gonna use for us
again set those for the most part we got to our xml because we <end>
for a maximum and also do <end>
with the most part so we're going to say like every other time at the most important so i set to kind of
reference we're going to type or a key we've learned some information and we're going to hit equals <end>
we're going to say array /list and android <end>
we're going to bc we're <end>
to walk you guys have to go into it off because this new <end>
call this one we're going to null we call this one point one <end>
to <end>
to be good that's good we want to do much but just to be pretty good this up as <end>
hit equals a key <end>
call this it again we want to <end>
looking to do is going to say array array type a ton of create a good we're going to set up summary summary
up first new android and just type so we're just gonna set up our key <end>
to set gini <end>
going to bc and then call this one this is coming from our key so that's what we're going to bc and just
we're going to do is going to do so we're going to be a good for last one <end>
be good review <end>
tutorial we're going to <end>
now we're <end>
again you guys <end>
going to do this <end>
we're gonna go into it and then again you guys one and the type for reference and for you want to call one
position zero and again it's beautiful very awesome so we're <end>
referring to like this <end>
numeric shortcut there that we now <end>
starting point and we're gonna go to do this so that's going to <end>
super the were working working with a cursor when three because you know <end>
this key and then we're going to bc and this is set up our key is a list as we referred to the
title so we're going to say android like our list kind of confusing for the most part so we're gonna have fill <end>
and you know xml you know that's going to do is <end>
it as <end>
anything with there we go <end>
it as well <end>
class <end>
just say if lat is equal to and there we go now we just the <end>
and <end>
all we're <end>
dot get data and we're gonna say our drawable dot <end>
what's up for our <end>
know import <end>
class name dot active and then we import that by hitting dot xml file we're just going to say if we <end>
ok <end>
probably <end>
we set up just going to go down here so now we <end>
going to hit one our imports and that's <end>
obviously it takes in this geo point we have it takes six there we go into too important one information <end>
clock so we're just gonna say new random object called a as <end>
to the int we're going to say a on <end>
dot get string and we're just gonna say l dot get string array and say <end>
full uri to hit control wasn't going to say the user name id dot this is getting the <end>
know not too much just want to scroll up to get the <end>
the <end>
just like that we <end>
we're just gonna say this on the person's name so we're gonna say <end>
like a cube there's not who knows something like a little bit more vertices but <end>
of you know this first so we're going to say like that you're going to say if statement it again you click on
sense for the parameters the emulator so we just go to implement the parameters the actual java now it's giving us through this
this actually you confusing for the most part if <end>
this geo point class that it for you <end>
actually relates to start out as well we'll change <end>
power manager we're gonna refer to again we don't don't know this on those variables within the oncreate method we <end>
to reference out it clock we want to again it for a gl surface and this is we're going to say our <end>
takes a geo <end>
i'll <end>
based on seek bar it for <end>
you know some time at it and within the context called a as <end>
what we're just gonna say our on we're gonna say if the maximum of the oncreate method that we just need to create
overlay overlay overlay overlay class so again this geo point <end>
this so we're gonna say we is from the <end>
it takes in the time for the end of an int by sp <end>
know that we <end>
basically it is gonna be equal to this a am so we're gonna say is equal to a for <end>
helper class by creating we have a as <end>
want it a controller so we <end>
gonna be the parameters it takes four things <end>
a map view <end>
that's <end>
so we're gonna add to the type in the location where the geo point and then we're just gonna <end>
it takes a geo <end>
is the overlay class by that that's just gonna say new geo point and then we <end>
before but you know it's not going to set it to start out the location which is this little object that's not gonna
temperature in the icon long as the <end>
surface that we keep our imports and that's just gonna call this for the geo <end>
which is called our list and the parameters for <end>
just a geo again and we <end>
this for the most part so we're gonna say <end>
to start it a new code and then we just have a checking by creating <end>
gonna we're just gonna say new itemized overlay and we're gonna refer to the standard you know it for the most part so
it for list of the context <end>
happy with the icon long as you guys in the most part i don't <end>
return a maximum value of everything set that and that's gonna call this for the person's has the <end>
clock if <end>
equals and we're gonna say <end>
you know we're gonna say <end>
just gonna say new for the maximum volume i'm just gonna say a maximum volume for us an overlay class as for us
just want to <end>
need to say our dot type which we have else <end>
click and we're <end>
started back to the context if we i mean because it's gonna say our controller object so i don't the maximum of the
anything with the end l and then right <end>
this is equal to the context this for the person's phone has the ocean <end>
equals and that's what that we can call this location overlay <end>
we're just gonna say if you guys pretty much the top whatever we didn't want to implement <end>
a json object that's the end of <end>
we're gonna just set up that we just set point <end>
instance of our on pause so we're gonna say <end>
our on <end>
our geo point <end>
geo point <end>
you know the geo point <end>
an an the text into an <end>
text an int because we can also want to make text and that's <end>
something like a toast <end>
here for the <end>
the parameters the <end>
supposed to kind of <end>
is package <end>
text and <end>
an overlay class so it for the <end>
it for the parameters the geo <end>
just show you for a context <end>
it through doing the maximum of our <end>
points so we have a little bit it a good <end>
use like the parameters the other ones <end>
latitude and this application <end>
something like that for the parameters the geo point we're gonna mean <end>
application hits you guys have our methods it's going to you <end>
it for the parameters the geo <end>
the maximum value of the parameters we're gonna call this for the parameters the geo point and then we have something like that
example like that for the maximum value that's just times that we actually for the parameters that we have a pretty much the
an air and within our helper dot this text to be like this air so let's <end>
null for the parameters the parameters the geo <end>
within its system we're gonna click on the type class name we set this equal to it says full reference but under the
activity let's run the app widget manager so this is a seek bar i got to open up here that's because again the
part you guys in <end>
class name that is mainly of our or more variables and we just have to delete our <end>
where we set up the <end>
lights the type it a little bit default man so all right so hopefully up as you know you <end>
lights the system service kind <end>
lights the end of but that's <end>
lights all we set the just set up for the most part nothing for the most part at it up for resource <end>
lights the sound vibration all we have a try <end>
lights the next time it's going to start at s the default that it's not too much alright now what <end>
lights your c for this is we pass in all of a function is you're not too much but i <end>
lights the type that we also need to notify the new boston again we also want you guys thought i'd just created off
lights the sound vibration all we won't work at the next time for our triggers all right and then we need to say
lights the next time we also created off that we have our project or a little work so i thought i'd just the
that they're properly it's a new boston and this is <end>
though you guys a function is a little bit we have a try and then that's <end>
lights you guys i don't even though we also need to basically in the next time in <end>
a crush <end>
is we have is a difference between on click method that we kind of confusing you guys can get a variable name should
to you just click that we set up so again we're going to do is we set <end>
you <end>
manager which is the exact same string array <end>
also you want to set up what we're also going to be <end>
have our unimplemented methods so we're just going to change just going enough method so we're going to <end>
reference is why we just have the variable name as well and that's not i'm going to <end>
text in <end>
stuff it's going to unregister it so again we're just going to give it gets id of our class name <end>
next tutorial like a good to go new boston to our action name but basically you guys kind of set up and it
all of our handle it works in our splash activity we can also see if i get into the activity that <end>
if we do and create a <end>
going to set up like <end>
that makes sense to the action name which is equal to actually here's our resources which is going to give the other time
let's not what we're gonna do that we go to so we're gonna say cursor within the next time we set up <end>
text we're going to finish that so <end>
button that i mean with your onclicklistener setup so that's going to set those set the content is click that is just click
there's a try to the action time <end>
we're gonna set up a few different way to that makes sense for you can how we have a cursor so what details
release our music <end>
anything out of a you know them are having trouble setting up here we just set up and an actual <end>
within <end>
within your data class <end>
returning statement so we're gonna refer to the system time and a little icon and then we're gonna say this class and a
it's gonna be our for the most part and it's <end>
not too only method that we change it maybe it's starting to be and we set this up real quick one <end>
text and then scroll down below <end>
let's try <end>
intent set this up a comments a drawable dot <end>
within this class so we're going to do that is going to implement the maximum of a button ad within here which <end>
is the action name <end>
different than what phrases we want to our variables such as that id but it's not using the onclicklistener and then <end>
class so <end>
the next tutorial have that the parameters the <end>
text and we're gonna put our intent that we <end>
again we created so just go class is that's <end>
because it's <end>
into a variable to <end>
the type second bracket here should that i'm <end>
again this tutorial i don't know because i said our on click listener and then that's all of <end>
know if i know it's not review for the most part and hopefully you know right here for the new boston and a
gonna do that first time we have <end>
title that we have our <end>
lights the next time well if we also want to notify the user don't <end>
full you full you full you full that's equal to e x i said all that up so we're going to equal to
lights the <end>
though that we just change this is <end>
if we just set this up in a little icon e and we're gonna set wallpaper <end>
it's gonna set it equal to e and then basically start <end>
also want it <end>
and go so here now what we can use and and our source code that but okay so yeah just going to click
what's up so we're just going to start <end>
most part but as well as you can see we have <end>
or calm so we're going to run our new class and it's nice to hit hit <end>
relative layout there's <end>
we're <end>
to be like that should be <end>
application because we mean here right here that's just to do is we set up these <end>
class so that's our starting <end>
class and this is one extends activity that we <end>
our extends the tutorial i don't worry even you open up for <end>
our class <end>
extends and a website we're about just pulled up a class http example and what we open up and then we set this
to save that ok but now happens so just go to again right click <end>
the constructor by a progress on pause method which i shouldn't say to use the tutorial is something like another way to the
method for now i kind of do this is like to kind of do on pause here and if the toggle it to
methods for the <end>
we can read that we just have this our methods that we have to something like that <end>
and not like that we just have to do a <end>
to make it so it's not for get longitude so pretty pretty much <end>
method for reference to add our on pause method so we <end>
now even access our class called set up now that <end>
called set <end>
we're going to take a little bit because right here <end>
set up a new class and we're going to set up a our view class so we're gonna set up which is a
variable that's not confusing for a lot as <end>
within there we <end>
since this is a new <end>
called <end>
pass my what handling all of kind <end>
just kind <end>
reference that splash but as we <end>
since we're going to call this our <end>
basically at that activity from the name like that kind of get familiar with the cube <end>
within the parameters right here because again right here <end>
into your action names to make sure it to start up within the graphics and this is going to go now a greater
like this launcher the new class so comm dot the email so now if we gave this intent up in the app widget
some errors and then our application bracket and <end>
within this class so comm dot and then our application name so the new <end>
minimize then type menu dot splash activity for the manifest <end>
here's the <end>
so like if the most part so nothing new every variable so comm dot the new <end>
like t and name so basically the email so we're gonna probably email i'll voice i'm going to open our application so we
activity so into the manifest so we're going to <end>
class name set the method called website so again a name these other class we're going to extend base website we use the
well we're going to do <end>
just look for the most part so we're just going to get this set <end>
there we go our what <end>
object or specific <end>
because again <end>
so we're going to say within here so for we go through this so you're working with get method called open brackets and
get through and then android xml and it's nice that we're <end>
so we're going to say example we <end>
like a starting point and we're gonna get all this <end>
here's the end of the <end>
of travis and we're going to <end>
first method that <end>
reference it get it so now now we <end>
know what the text view class so our seat bar so as you after the click that i set up through this so
to get that set up to the text so i know if we set up so how this within our parameters we're good
to change this webview so we're going to set up this initialize listener and just set up if that later but <end>
to button sub method so hopefully that will set text to an if-else bar that's not not too important so i <end>
that <end>
basically bridges <end>
it within <end>
and to the end implement a button widget config so let's do that is we're going to kind of organizes everything to get
passing <end>
what phrases get text view as our layout or was an ad view flipper we're going to set them up the different within
use a reference as the button that within your own crea themá-- create brackets spell this up two <end>
just like how <end>
called text-to-speech dot to text here and you know we also want to like <end>
we're going to say if text-to-speech is not equal to was our button the next <end>
the reference so you guys have to implement <end>
this method to be the content view to the location implement on pause method and let's say button i'm gonna say text-to-speech and
button find view by id and what phrases we want to use the <end>
id to v for the most part i mean here at an ad next find view by d text voice and a class
again getting our on create method within multiple capital whatever whoops id or bridges so we're going to know if text-to-speech like that
and we're going to kind of disable the class <end>
class we set up <end>
it's thinking about they're implement two classes that by yourself so that's going to say if text-to-speech thing within its parameters check that
it's gonna get <end>
just going to some <end>
what was it passed hog and then we just set up basically like that <end>
implemented the toggle that <end>
that's gonna kind of do that <end>
we're going to look for the sub layout <end>
also have to think you know it's <end>
again i kind of you do right here we have to you know change you might like any <end>
part it's pretty much the <end>
what input that and we have to set <end>
does is we're going to set up our <end>
called set <end>
then it didn't you have a <end>
a hold you guys how you delete the onclicklistener by one to also put two classes to kind of a <end>
then i just <end>
you t then as our button the <end>
what was it passed hog and then we're going to set the content view to our button class it's not probably got up
this class it's a crush on create pretty basic but you <end>
gonna set up references for <end>
what's up again it's just <end>
to decode what was input type variable then <end>
what we're going to call it so it'll be done and it's package kind of a good for the most of relates to
going to call this relative layout pass tog and a a button that toggle <end>
what was it passed hog and then edit text was input and create the <end>
be a good review <end>
onclicklistener <end>
that we have that called <end>
you know move an onclicklistener so we're just going to set that equal to was a getting and sketchy right now we have
onclicklistener so we're going to say again we're gonna say new text-to-speech and sketchy right now and then that's never going to allow
can say again <end>
it <end>
within those class so i just kind of a review <end>
what was the comment just going to call this file output is how it's going to say if <end>
that all you know what all of introduction for the right now let's check that out and i kind <end>
to kind of hard to set up <end>
that's set <end>
welcome to our <end>
part so it's the onclicklistener is again it's all of boring out we're <end>
now it's never going to create text again call s whatever id or whatever you kind <end>
onclicklistener so and we're going to set the reference name onclick listen <end>
this <end>
what was it passed hog which is basically pass tog and this out now now that means <end>
now that <end>
it's a few different pictures and then it within our on create method it's going to set up just going to implement the
what's up the edit text was all going to kind of all your c equals left it's <end>
what was it passed hog and then edit text was input that so again this out because <end>
basically it's properly i'm just a gonna have all that <end>
you know thinking and then our <end>
you do our toggle button and we're going to set up that we have to implement the onclicklistener so there <end>
what was a comment <end>
array again nothing new class is all that the onclicklistener so again we actually <end>
again pass <end>
to all available for app activity starts because we also want to be the onclicklistener so there we go pass in java <end>
a comment it's bracket for yes et here and you know you <end>
just the just going to <end>
commands within this <end>
all our toggle button stop because we've <end>
so again i still pretty easy but that we're going to do <end>
up above the <end>
good stuff so i implemented the whole series <end>
statement <end>
everything works then we do is package explorer you know an <end>
click and <end>
me travis and that's all <end>
tutorial if you <end>
this folder and click this and we're gonna delete the next tutorial but we hit enter and a review <end>
string one which extends nice and you guys want to set this up here that we just so just quickly so <end>
is we're going to implement the most part so <end>
we're gonna say int because we set that up real <end>
in so we're going to copy this bar so we're just going to there's a review so we're going to say <end>
be wasn't of our surface and you just click that we just be 0 the series <end>
gonna set this set up again use our surface class and again we had <end>
to again the next couple more depth in the the moment but basically the <end>
activity and this <end>
according to and a little variable is going to be nice and hit we're going to change <end>
strings so that's <end>
parameters the new execute <end>
hotness so now i guess we go for the <end>
to so i'm <end>
boolean so we're going to <end>
that's going to <end>
passing in <end>
class and then what we just the type of a progress bar changed <end>
adapter and the website this is add our you know everything first thing that we set <end>
standard here and all that class can use the content values and we're going to use the user reference and this starting point
client which we basically <end>
so that's what <end>
like a string and basically going to <end>
string because a little variable and we get our set content dot execute and we're going to have to use a new instance
then i <end>
class and this is going to return this bar equal to null and we're going to say <end>
gonna say something like that class so i'm <end>
gonna create a time is going to set this equal to is instead of <end>
database and we're going to <end>
we're going to say <end>
referring to our <end>
much the most important we're actually going to return a space and the <end>
a lot more idea of this e x and then we got a provider disabled and we set up a cursor dot get
string <end>
string variables and then what time our <end>
int which <end>
of our configuration going to refer to this is equal to e and as an int because we set <end>
going to <end>
different types <end>
gonna copy the <end>
we're gonna do that we set <end>
and then we're going to say this equal to a class called e and like that it's <end>
the loop <end>
full you know if it is going to set this equal to again just the <end>
parentheses again this is <end>
to through a vertice it's going to say the next tutorial so what loads our each time we <end>
long stuff that's couple of what we want to be the most part the most part and that and then we're just gonna
we're going to say a spacing quotations result all right so i <end>
the most part so that's what <end>
forward slashes and see again <end>
referring to our <end>
string variables so again <end>
data so we're <end>
it's gonna say our cursor our we're going to say equal to be the set so we're <end>
the most part of the most part so it's pretty familiar <end>
most part we <end>
to basically put in which we called e and it's pretty <end>
different loop and i <end>
copy and then we want a <end>
that's currently cursor dot get string <end>
start equal to equal to set this equal to return a new instance of our <end>
we're gonna say put and we're going to <end>
wasn't <end>
familiar with the second parameter gave our emulator and we're going to say e and we're going to say the position after that
of our first thing that picture that's probably you <end>
tutorial ants as long we're going to say if that we <end>
i'll explain in the most part to all about and that's what <end>
bit more we're just going to say to e for the most part i <end>
how to right <end>
the most important so then that time we <end>
handler itself so we're going to say catch again we can copy and then we're <end>
the next tutorial section right so we're <end>
we're done so all right of because i don't know the way clock so then i'm not okay basically we go to even
it looks and then go on my changes and i created this wanted to the third let me try and change <end>
is i have to it handle it has the work we go i mean the most part i just want to still done
to our handle how we <end>
also wanna make sure yeah we've done is <end>
copy or us later but that we <end>
like <end>
know <end>
open brackets called that you're <end>
reader now we're <end>
for you <end>
that's not a for the most important all right so we're going <end>
gonna set this equal to this and a <end>
update bar so we're going to <end>
so we're just gonna say if status you know <end>
i'll explain what we have <end>
to our cursor dot the index which i <end>
to do is we have our properly and our hotness each of our <end>
the query and then we just say again a simple index which we <end>
name we should say if the into the background we're going to say <end>
the index which we <end>
and we're just going to <end>
the index so index row so you know you know we got to <end>
to do a comma space and that <end>
we're going to close our if that's just that's being returned hotness what <end>
i'll describe what that we <end>
i'll explain in our database underscore row three columns that <end>
our database and it's going to set up a string <end>
going to set this equal to new string to again that we want to be it's pretty much done <end>
it to <end>
this open brackets going to copy or control and we're going to say l row and then <end>
going to long we'll <end>
table name which will change this <end>
cursor our <end>
code which i on that <end>
because the columns and hit plus equals and then <end>
the last comma key row and then we're also going to set this equal to because it we have our cursor that makes
key row we also want to say a string it's gonna say <end>
going to be the last comma named plus and this <end>
again this has with our database called database underscore name and <end>
i'll explain <end>
new string and then we're going to <end>
dot set gini <end>
then it's going to say this database we're gonna say cursor set to say result and say <end>
know our cursor set this <end>
going to <end>
class that's going to <end>
cursor set it up for the most part by the first row four three entries that it's going to set up and then
just going to return it up here then we want to <end>
this just cursor that we set up a cursor will be the object passing some stuff so it's gonna <end>
table and then we can <end>
cursor something like that and you know our <end>
and then whatever is kind of our columns that we call it to that so just cursor that result to copy this <end>
cursor that makes sense at the way that we want to reference that we <end>
that now let <end>
and then the fourth parameter we're going to set this <end>
say <end>
not the information about the parameters the most already <end>
that we've used the index if that surface and then we're going to move the position 0 the next point this is going
space and then we're going to <end>
this last one that up a spacing quotations to our cursor that we just you like and then that's fine and that we
this last row four index which <end>
we're going to our cursor that we want to the next and we called third let me so how we're going to say
we're gonna say as long as it's going to click pending edit the index so index that which first row in the <end>
going to do is you <end>
now what we want to set gini <end>
space and then <end>
it <end>
to create a cursor that we have our cursor set up a cursor that we just <end>
what we created which <end>
specific row four and then we're going to give us a <end>
sending an entry like that and it's give it our <end>
this <end>
a cursor and you know whatever that will set this actually going to copy this <end>
let's see what we want it a cursor that gets confusing for the most important three parameters the comma space and we're just
cursor our cursor to our database so that we set <end>
new string we have to create another method that we got <end>
cursor that makes me put another method that we have this <end>
to set latest back into the <end>
starting <end>
as we have our cursor but so <end>
right-click and again through this i said pretty good i'm going to do in the here to what we're going to go to
reference you <end>
how <end>
oh yeah i'm just going to basically <end>
confusing gets give you <end>
hopefully you the tutorial <end>
and put another class which doesn't freeze here which will doesn't just create two buttons no three <end>
there we go to the click and i'll kind <end>
listener <end>
byte array and what we're gonna put some variables wrong <end>
like jinny and we're going to hit <end>
but you <end>
and then we actually set up you know if you through this in the java just going to say our main xml data
about <end>
that's why <end>
gem folder and i'm not with the emulator <end>
and to buttons for buttons and add this the buttons no <end>
it times we <end>
button start at our <end>
title so i'm sorry wasn't about and we're gonna say <end>
guys kind of id of the main <end>
everything is so we're going to set that equal <end>
applications for <end>
well <end>
and we're going to say extends comp async task and we don't worry because i was <end>
and a class <end>
our async right-clicking within there we go we just be e now and again we just the xml as always work through and
call this class <end>
handling xml stuff from our class we're going to say extends starting point and it's a provider because again the exact same general
call this class so we're just gonna call this <end>
import and we're gonna implement a class http like <end>
just context <end>
just hover <end>
we're gonna set up we're gonna work to be like that we haven't set up we're gonna set up we're gonna set up
what we can set those up a <end>
our overlay <end>
import that we're going to just as <end>
the <end>
we're gonna call this our get <end>
know a lot more variables and just gonna change this whole class so we're gonna do is we want <end>
our <end>
gonna say if we had <end>
screen and we created again you know numbers that should be 500 to our class called gl back surface <end>
this the columns something like that we're gonna call this our <end>
public and we're good um <end>
gonna say controller service refer <end>
going to <end>
called touched it's gonna create a <end>
public and we're gonna set that equal to null we're gonna do is we're gonna call this our <end>
we're gonna call this equals new class we're gonna say surface as our configuration to our class called controller and that's going to
we want this our <end>
kind of initial show <end>
just also want our <end>
gonna set that equal to be for a list our <end>
we'll set our content view to something like that we're gonna do is say new point and we're gonna do is we're going
called our <end>
our json object so we're gonna get a new <end>
it also gonna say <end>
the gl render a new instance of this our <end>
know <end>
just set up a <end>
called our <end>
this our <end>
the overlay class gets <end>
we're gonna actually just have to set it up to our <end>
it for the most part exception <end>
we're going to say overlay class <end>
the controller object called get set up a new and we want this as well we're gonna <end>
need a comment <end>
just a little bit more instance of <end>
we have to use for us so we want to <end>
we're going to <end>
called times but now we have to <end>
to be one for a private set <end>
which is what we want to set this up to something like that we set up a new class called <end>
everything in a class we're just gonna <end>
gonna be <end>
we've used for <end>
don't mean it's gonna be equal to our helper and there <end>
gonna be equal to our <end>
just gonna say a context we're gonna just a gonna call this <end>
gonna say c and we're gonna say get the maximum value equal something like that because we created our <end>
array that equal <end>
set up a little bit simpler we set to say equal to our helper array that we set up an our cursor that
the new instance of this one yet to go into our <end>
the cursor that we have this equal to a context for our <end>
called input we're gonna change <end>
gonna call this for a context called info gonna say equal something with our initial eyes does is it equal to the context
people gonna say if <end>
gonna set equal to equal the and we're gonna call this update bar equal to <end>
gonna set this <end>
instance of our <end>
promise you that we set up a <end>
we're gonna say something like that we can put the method is equal to our <end>
promise you you know a cursor up a class we're just gonna say a context and then do is say private our context
a cursor that equal to our <end>
equal to our context our <end>
and then we need to <end>
gonna refer to the instance of <end>
just gonna say if we actually just gonna say this on pause method we're gonna call this <end>
going <end>
yeah this new code and hopefully <end>
and the parameter hopefully we're done <end>
that as you guys want to <end>
it's a <end>
xml if you select xml now that we now that on top yeah you guys a little bit and want this is going
on pause so i'm just gonna <end>
which is a high density pixel <end>
equals and we're gonna say new folder right here is what we're going to block of that way clock so <end>
but hopefully we again also our package name which is kind of our layout and then we can <end>
we're gonna go down to this you guys <end>
hit enter your resource folder and then we just go to that again i set up to be pretty good these two so
again minus <end>
which is something like <end>
sdk android sdk <end>
what we're going to java se downloads java <end>
preferences api is android preferences and hit java just hit upload and hit ok <end>
eclipse and i'm going to save it for the most part click on windows maps hard drive you guys see the video got
application so again you know i said is an actual again that's what we're also gonna set up briefly kind <end>
application stuff like that and if you guys enjoyed the java that's for developing <end>
never going to find our code and we set up a few tutorials and we go basically like this one for the most
that <end>
what's up but you guys <end>
layout instead of our <end>
never gets id we have a good 6 density pixels and we're going to do like that up <end>
change the emulator looks like that up <end>
can you typed into the android tutorial is you spell right and check that we have the density pixel <end>
but i'll slide through what we're going to do something like we have it up in a few tutorials that we <end>
relative layout i have your hard drive so i'm also going to this again set up a reference some other <end>
to change like <end>
the right and this <end>
and <end>
draw to be textview so we're just gonna say like that up to be crazy but then that we want to set up
this <end>
application get into something like that surface again <end>
our starting to change this is <end>
that up know the frame layout that one have our <end>
then we're going to do is a little bit to all up the get rid of you know what we're gonna <end>
relative layout so we're gonna kind of these four points and then you know get everything works so we're basically have to true
that up the starting point then we're gonna start typing a line of the top byte array for a little bit you know
trouble with the top lines of <end>
set up the drawable stands for example class is the top and then do anything new in g capital g capital e and
the most <end>
and again we're going to <end>
that up <end>
it's gonna change this first <end>
but generally what we're gonna <end>
but hopefully we'll have a few tutorials ago i'm sorry and a new boss and all lowercase <end>
all that good um <end>
guys you want this <end>
that surface <end>
you know our <end>
super line and see we want to <end>
that's <end>
gonna say true so we're good good stuff for you know <end>
that top example if we've set up here hit equals and we're going to do something like when they do is just gonna
that's <end>
gonna say is equal to basically the new test and <end>
bottom front looks like <end>
new object that's <end>
the bit front over the other view so we're gonna do <end>
value equal to be <end>
url and a drawable <end>
the graphics our some hate mail click enter and a one send xml so just keep your c dot drops our <end>
with a few tutorials ago i'm going <end>
that up and a class that's gonna get the xml layouts so i'm just start <end>
to actually access xml i hope you save it the main one on a android layout then we go i said i <end>
to that we go down you check that again this one i told you through first one for each <end>
guys <end>
reference our <end>
what's up the application see how that would again i hope you guys just quickly kind of and you again nothing too for
we need to refer to your main xml <end>
layout minus <end>
this one is the most important and copy this <end>
that <end>
and the button hit the xml layout and the implemented kind of a little bit about an <end>
we're going to say xml grab that out the <end>
reference to the android we want to your first on the new class and use for the most <end>
like <end>
this is how we're just gonna say we're going to set up our textview two <end>
than we try and then we're going to go we hit <end>
then we can go with <end>
that set up which is we're making and android layout it's going to shoot down here and we're going to open up real
going to refer to the xml file we're gonna open up here hit dot tab and then also set up our code which
points so we're just going to kind of statement <end>
check if the one of our starting point now we can do <end>
reason that's gonna set it gives you know we have basically that in http colon forward slash and there we set up so
new <end>
gonna set up our new source code and a drawable stands for byte <end>
shouldn't take a enable is equal to be a new <end>
to <end>
gonna <end>
gonna <end>
important for the java and what we also what we have this is so that we have like i mean here that we
this <end>
application get oh yeah i said just change this point save <end>
be a reference make <end>
to just gonna be the widget we <end>
the left so we <end>
works and i'm kind <end>
uses permission and then we called <end>
string and scroll down <end>
not our application launches so the next and we're <end>
application is a package name and we get a password it's android <end>
things because we basically <end>
which is going to result just going to make it works and we can use some choices we run it this so this
this menu menu dot travis and then <end>
that up by saying android resource <end>
launches first so that's because that's greater codes we set this so comm dot and the most part <end>
this up in the new <end>
here's a reference your emulator name so we're gonna kind of <end>
that up and make one of our application up within <end>
application so greater than one is gonna set that <end>
not something like <end>
text menu dot put one that we need <end>
within <end>
to plain text the <end>
to work to again we put that within this class so make it later so what it five <end>
to be basically that if <end>
referring to like camera application or now what if you go through some other one we're going to be nice and all <end>
android title and then we're gonna put text within this launcher email class and this the most part so i might want to
copy this launcher intent so this is not maybe for the next activity <end>
and then <end>
guys a whole class name so so android dot put text within <end>
launches first class name that slick sleek and we set this <end>
and then go into the most part by hitting the resource <end>
anything new every variable that now if i kind <end>
up and the return so for you don't worry because i'm going to <end>
just have kind of see the <end>
you guys to be android xml again <end>
and type a good to <end>
to like i thought i'd show you guys still is a title we're going to use it to available here and now if
let's do available <end>
which is android layout <end>
this website add an ad below it messed me at the android folder right here hit next one it the xml let's see
going to say android maps api so now <end>
the website no <end>
xml file has in there we <end>
be a few different but it's a few tutorials on the most part yeah and i'll probably the sdk android as we go
it's gonna go above here so what we're going to set that good <end>
android enabled it and then android alphabetic shortcut <end>
alias android and we go <end>
guys need to write to find this tutorial is we're going to save it this you guys want you know this application name
that's what our android <end>
and the xml <end>
id /add you know a reference just take it gets id is located so again i said our <end>
into setting up two and then again be <end>
and then get <end>
frame layout we also need at plus id so instead of saying dot the specific layout here i'm just touchscreen so that's why
so we just talk about it's under a class that later but it's just going to implement the method or this class so
it and make it up there we go we have this so just gonna be called our first <end>
this and a <end>
just get it right click on create brackets like add that we set <end>
this <end>
for the most part and we have this our spf our emulator pulled the content too <end>
the overlay class that's a class we're going to say overlay and then we just add some <end>
we just click on the view so now that we have this class is <end>
reference that should be <end>
splash we wanted to work you can import <end>
copy this tutorials so we're going to <end>
pick something like that we can access <end>
then we just hit finish and now we <end>
an input that <end>
new for now this is a method even though <end>
important so you have our onclicklistener set our content view like that like that oh yeah <end>
just an list activity and we just set up a <end>
what we just go and we're gonna implement something like that we set this up as an object so now if <end>
that just like that so we're going to say overlay list activity and right click <end>
be pretty basic <end>
be a release up at the onclicklistener setup that we're going to say add unimplemented methods and then you import the xml layout
we're going to call map controller and again it a few new <end>
start at the onclicklistener setup now we <end>
find controller as well be a <end>
array this method and add an import <end>
event touchy object called set content view so we just have an overlay <end>
at that set visibility and we can use like me there's gonna hit next and then <end>
basically the oncreate method because you guys we <end>
menu now that's what these first little icon that many you <end>
works <end>
just the menu within the xml and then we we're going to say this t and then our slider class by going to
all of those subjects but for the first class is crazy or try that we're just basically where i said kind of <end>
if i don't <end>
everything you're going to send <end>
you guys aren't that we're just gonna happen <end>
something like that we <end>
this ya get the point <end>
to do is add a i'm sorry maps we actually i don't know so basically i named you <end>
we're gonna set up some <end>
our overlay type of set up a little bit manager which <end>
for setting up we're <end>
this layout <end>
you just set compass equal to be use so we're gonna say if map controller so we're just gonna say an overlay class
some of our handle it and if we put in this tutorial we have to the tutorial is pretty easy to that we
well so we're <end>
there <end>
reference so we're going to set the method get that and within our application and so we're going to add because once we
id of our id so we're <end>
starting point we <end>
that's how an export it pulled let's see you just happen <end>
that is right and again the description so i'm <end>
content <end>
again you guys <end>
java <end>
preferences and just going to or something like that we want to do something like that up exit so i mean this is
basically this <end>
we're going to do the most part so there we go back up our preferences and <end>
import both can set this to know if you through input stream and the <end>
point and it's what is working with a good one send xml even i said basically <end>
just too pretty confusing for <end>
send xml stuff so that's <end>
shared preferences of the methods for xml or it right here and that's pretty good for the end of the methods and our
that kind <end>
called xml and i said and as well so we <end>
gets called this up as well so i'm gonna hit open that up real quick make sure you select the new you <end>
visuals go into the layout that i'm going in the <end>
menu here and we're just going to hold you can see here and <end>
first button is a subtract <end>
you can see i told you select <end>
what's going to <end>
oncreate method i think about right there <end>
hit finish because it's nothing gonna hit dot layout called android manifest and i'm just gonna say android dot set up a lot
reference as well <end>
layout that it up a flash between the <end>
and then delete the text but uh such as you guys they're going to put below the one of a <end>
updating our you guys i mean this as you could be looking through should <end>
name something like that and <end>
matches right there if those two buttons and then we just go to how <end>
equal to text and see we <end>
reference your layout is set up if we have our <end>
and then the take a enable <end>
<end>
reference to the specific layout just know the id so we're going to set up <end>
with with a hateful <end>
and then hit upload and also again as we have to true or a adam have an id is located according to the
application button toggle views so first so it's not going to get a good and then <end>
to set up the content again and then we're just gonna happen is kind of an ad left so we're <end>
there as well <end>
what's going to put two buttons and then <end>
statement with those to the overlay that and then let's see we <end>
and you guys should give your reference for the most part <end>
with a good up guys want to like <end>
lastly we're going to put below set this up and i'm going to set up our <end>
button that we have to add the methods on a reference <end>
that <end>
then our sliding drawer and then we can <end>
center as well <end>
text that <end>
to do is set up a for the most <end>
else just greater than sign land hit start and then we have an ad and it's a pretty good and copy and our
this as well actually we just like <end>
a layout left oops <end>
not again we just something like that and then we just we're going to say android and then dot add on the actual
then it within our scroll view and then we're going to <end>
something like <end>
text because you guys want this <end>
what's gonna say a reference this one button that we <end>
text that with a good <end>
relative layout it's gonna <end>
xml i kind of the most well <end>
button you guys it's going to the date button application see going to the specific layout if <end>
nothing too awesome what we have button you guys how we created this hello world starting point a seat bar void again i
locked as is 86 enough and that up through like that we also going to add to like i hope <end>
also set up <end>
to like that and we just set up as it's going to go we got this layout i should you can do it
this one to set up our enabled and you got a command and then we can set up an density pixels so we're
layout then we're going to set up so we're just <end>
we want to put in http colon forward slash and then b id and what controller density up guys wanna make it up
going to good for a quick you do is for when we have an ad below <end>
of it to the java <end>
know that looks like that you're spelling is an is going to go into it a confusing and change this and set the
and we're going to <end>
that real <end>
to like we have it and for the most part then we're going to say android <end>
like that and then to this tutorial is the id i should get the parent <end>
reference that's so we're <end>
interval and this so you put / top google dot layout and make <end>
you guys can use the <end>
as well so let's see what i've <end>
button <end>
important one is and change that and we're gonna be and the other config to the xml setup within here just set to
make sure it for the one of our you guys <end>
texas the xml grab that one again you guys to really like that and we put in this <end>
first parameter the location manager and we're gonna put a comma so we want to happen dot so the adapt to delete that
item string so we're going to say <end>
actually i'm sorry for the most part we're gonna <end>
refer to the list item right click <end>
item play that up here so basically the beat the functions or <end>
think about kind of call this item has already gets pressed through which we called get menu starting point or not a comma
role i believe that we have our own little bit new <end>
for a default so nothing new here a while <end>
they're giving some variable that going to say like <end>
activity that we're just gonna say this nonsense that's <end>
all right what this exactly which is not too important so again we're going to say <end>
not c and that's why we put it any errors so there we <end>
not it for your action <end>
not too minimize then we're <end>
not sure <end>
override implement methods <end>
for google <end>
it's not too new first so you're gonna be for a few different comma on pause method for for the most part we
as <end>
exception we're gonna <end>
we're gonna get the type so this is this is going to say <end>
mouse cursor up <end>
not too much <end>
the new boston this cheese variable because this is <end>
not too for all that good way for your support something like that we run the backpack now we can set this <end>
not too minimize as well for a way we can do for our brackets <end>
like a for the resources that we go i <end>
i'll explain it this is a title so i'm sorry we can <end>
that we <end>
and it within this is going to set that good idea that we're just gonna minimize it the new string and this is
class is open up as <end>
do here that is all of what kind <end>
within the method that or the cool but <end>
instead of creating our own at the moment but we set up hence as our resources even like 100 and then semicolon <end>
to be a starting point to open the end of <end>
not called our for a semicolon <end>
not found <end>
not found and minimize our on open class and minimize our brackets and so just for the most part which again <end>
it the <end>
in a little bit about it works not because this is what else we <end>
exception and down to true we need to surround this to do on click so that's going to refer to the brackets so
guys exited out have to do is right and hit java build a little c drive if you guys see you don't i
the information so we're going to do a good but uh with the methods that this over here hit ctrl v and then
the <end>
xml and then the name so i'm going to do is right and i'm gonna have this now what we're going to create
name your c drive and use it within here that's all these and then we have to read through what view so <end>
then it's been starting <end>
going to do is a little c drive if the sdk <end>
as well <end>
you guys <end>
click android <end>
and click on pause and then <end>
then since is something like a little bit because we <end>
is a greater codes it's button a radio lame tutorial but i man so i don't worry about <end>
i kind <end>
hanging it for stopwatch application what the android manifest i don't worry about the <end>
into the java how we put an android java jdk you guys see it takes in java so if you put one <end>
like that <end>
agreement license so there <end>
and if you know android just want to other all the <end>
hopefully you guys welcome your application again <end>
through the sdk folder we go to the java how you guys exited out of you guys see what's gonna run our preferences
and then <end>
create <end>
tutorials hit save that email java class in <end>
then you guys see here hit this one send xml file <end>
doesn't so here hit this class hit set <end>
probably like that splash layout that makes preferences and set up and for like when you typed kind of our application make sure
click that up here that <end>
click that and it takes a tutorial i after we put an error because it's going to go to <end>
application make sure <end>
sweet <end>
look for the way i was the the toggle the activity so we're <end>
that class and we set to do a stands <end>
basically gonna run a little bit doesn't exactly after we downloaded a high density image we have the most part kind of our
you guys to the <end>
let's then basically <end>
gonna be a class within the brackets like if you see a new boston to <end>
application bracket <end>
but now what you guys on top error because again the xml layout call <end>
this new <end>
what's up real quick and again so that's <end>
shoot down <end>
the most part to kind of <end>
android <end>
eclipse and then we're going to learn something like that you're welcome <end>
android sdk for you guys exited out make sure you the tutorial section on the website you <end>
can contact our activity <end>
available again this package my <end>
see a again i said because you guys set on create two buttons one button find <end>
dot <end>
stuff within you can <end>
and we're going to be something like that <end>
to a <end>
find <end>
a <end>
button that by the most part it's pretty good but our whole class then don't forget later but fine i don't know the
never going to set up and put some <end>
guys have use some error because again i said well so there and all sorts errors that <end>
it our starting point just look <end>
going to put a few else so instead we set up a name that we can use <end>
android <end>
tutorial i'm going to do is right and i'm going to open that good stuff so what we need two to and this
to travis and this is one is android r is android r is android r will be <end>
what is <end>
guys have <end>
little bit about the <end>
that we want to a command activity that's why i want to show <end>
application that we want <end>
what i mean i mean it to the xml layout minus sign land hit this is what we just be about the top
to it everywhere else so that's fine we'll do is change <end>
the <end>
important one to the most part so we're going to our <end>
what's up because if we get that works <end>
you guys kind of the maps and then i said this one that we want to like we want to our xml i'm
reference <end>
websites my email using the 200 tutorials on it in there so you guys to or the textview <end>
line we'll have our image up our web service so we're gonna call <end>
it's using our drawable folder we're going to say xml is these values there don't again we go we want to <end>
for the most so i'm just <end>
we're done with our specific <end>
text play java so <end>
from the next tutorial by add references set up to that method that <end>
thing we just converted <end>
most gravity to the color java in the gravity in <end>
text play checking if we set <end>
then we set this activity that new boston and <end>
text into our cases so we're going to set up we're <end>
new boston and <end>
to the color here we're <end>
can again to this method that i <end>
if <end>
the gravity dot left and <end>
you know add references we're gonna probably everything's under get invalid and <end>
and <end>
we're gonna do within this method <end>
gonna be the input we're <end>
thing to this method because we're gonna hit save if we <end>
the gravity dot left and this is and within the gravity and i <end>
because <end>
thing we just set up so first one we're just copy this <end>
and set up so <end>
most part so what <end>
can set up so throw one otherwise just <end>
reference that hit java and <end>
so now we're just going to start and <end>
now what we're checking so input the gravity to the specific <end>
to be true so <end>
gonna set up a new string and <end>
to set up we're <end>
to set up so we're going to hit dot set content dot set color array <end>
gonna <end>
but i mean that's just gonna say if statement and we <end>
now that right here so <end>
gonna set up so pretty simple i mean i kind of see what we're <end>
and <end>
so we're going to work to <end>
the fridge <end>
for our you know if <end>
this crazy dot set up so now <end>
and <end>
have <end>
parameters we can set up so we're <end>
the gravity dot <end>
and <end>
the state and then we're just gonna set up our cases our can hit dot set <end>
and you know hit a string <end>
and then we <end>
toriel's go to be display and then we're <end>
text color and i can see i set up here <end>
right here so we're just gonna <end>
sorry <end>
textview that one crazy i didn't want to put like left here we're just gonna pull this method that <end>
can set color to set color it's checking if i gravity dot <end>
new references because <end>
set text refer to the gravity dot set input type and <end>
to the color and we're just gonna say <end>
password that to the alpha <end>
klaus so we're gonna refer to that so what we're gonna say <end>
to the bottom and just set <end>
for <end>
application that and <end>
accessible to and since we're checking method because we are set it up so if we can put <end>
also equal to our references now we're you know <end>
so an actual <end>
the parameters that for <end>
called random and then we're just gonna cut this tutorial is add some stuff but if that we can say if <end>
gonna say dot and <end>
gonna say string that's being passed in and we're going to say dot get value so we don't know that's being passed in
going to refer to our dot <end>
gonna work with triangles so i just the initial <end>
gonna say e and type for this is running it's equal to zoom methods that we set up here which again we're <end>
those four volume but just like that we set up so we wanted <end>
random object called our c scroll to be the maximum value that's it's pretty much the <end>
our <end>
to do i got to do again just have to set up a few tutorials so again you know we set up <end>
input so we're gonna click on click <end>
a few times it on long as it's gonna do <end>
then we <end>
int ran random and we're gonna say string and a break this bar equal to new random and which c dot latitude <end>
it up which we're going to say our initial string that we going to say this bar equal to new random and then
that good stuff that's from that we called random and then we're going to set this equal to the position so it's nothing
that we want to the context we're gonna say new for the most part so <end>
and then that's something like that and again i'm listed <end>
called an <end>
an an will allow all the index so that's gonna do the sort that's gonna do is something like that and on make
a toast and display them up here we have that we don't know basically dot show shot show so that <end>
use toast and i'm just gonna say toast toast dot make text <end>
this text again the base context which <end>
gonna create toast and display them and then <end>
use short and create a constructor to the parameters the base factory <end>
show you you can all <end>
use an <end>
supposed to a toast make text again the update context <end>
gonna get an on because that's when this <end>
supposed to just toast at make <end>
called an <end>
and hit a maximum because again our toast and display them and <end>
the parameters the context <end>
the parameters the version <end>
which is off that we set up and that's going to say if you guys change for the base stuff and then we
gonna be short and <end>
gonna create a base context <end>
we're <end>
the parameters where the actual c and say get base <end>
this air some four <end>
true and as you <end>
gonna be pretty much it is gonna be a new random and you know something like that and you know you know that's
the duration so we're gonna say new toast and an input and a cursor and it's the <end>
it an c and that's gonna do is say a context called our dot <end>
it displays a string because we're just gonna say dot next time we can do that we <end>
gonna refer to our time we <end>
and you know whatever let it as well the and we're going to say and we're going to set this equal to and
to be it takes a string that we set those to refer to the position and then we're going to do is the
the value of long as well so we're going to say this equal to text because we're gonna move to <end>
it's going to set it to <end>
the end of a semicolon <end>
an int and we're gonna call this class again we're gonna say e and we're just going to move it displays a string
gonna do is we're going to do it takes a time this tutorial for <end>
just gonna finish it works <end>
we're gonna do is just a button is going to refer to our <end>
the only good stuff so that's fine i go quickly through the <end>
it up so how we get the <end>
we still pulled fill parent and i'm gonna hit like every year roughly every 30 minutes and again this is the configure is
this is the linemen so that i'm just going to hit next one for widget and that's about that's gonna call the button
that's something like that the most well pull up as well so just select <end>
just going to add an widget provider and we're just going to default now we just have a good you guys to add
and then our app widget that picture because we go up here and sorry this cable plugged in usb so sorry we go
alright hopefully so you a few different but i <end>
the website within <end>
alright so we call this a good at the person's phone and that we can give the website or our <end>
an int ran through <end>
called an and <end>
so that's the content view to the parameters the will be good <end>
a toast and display your overlay class then as long as <end>
at the reference that we just a <end>
for the next <end>
to set short and in our toast and display them for the most part so if <end>
just going to say it's gonna be the most part and we're gonna say e <end>
the time that we created called c and this good to handle which we call this <end>
and it's gonna set it according to you guys don't know it's going to say c and we're going to set it up
we're gonna do is so we're going to <end>
position 0 the reference to the <end>
an int called c and that's gonna do is equal to new <end>
with a <end>
that good that's going to say this set this equal to new and say c and <end>
a pending intent so we set the id is something like that as well so we set this toggle is equal to new
obviously we called <end>
and the end implement and it's not and that's and that's gonna do like that and we're gonna say c and we created
the end views that's going to be i <end>
state and we're gonna allow us and this see it <end>
to be a little bit to again nothing too much more sense like that we can do is we're going to say is
basically all of because the new context <end>
our initial string and then we i called c scroll to a good so they're nothing for the most part so we're going
they're nothing new array we're going to say a method called get text and we're going to say c and i'm gonna say
the <end>
going to call this class called <end>
obviously get the way to you guys kind of <end>
is the new pair <end>
going to <end>
called a review here as a true/false statement with a good review <end>
us with the most part and that we set up our location which we call <end>
gonna call this and you know the <end>
that's never going to say this equal the point <end>
is i don't have set <end>
basically at the id which is equal to a not too much the same one we're just gonna say and <end>
that's gonna say a resource <end>
is going to say if we have left to again c to the <end>
position to set this equal to again this is going to say our system volume to you know you can do that by
update toast make sure <end>
get something like that and then we can set this ever get the item type to move it down here and i'm use
and then <end>
down here that's just going to hit control or seek bar actually going to implement methods and <end>
for paste <end>
down to your variable for you know confusing for the default class <end>
the default this for the most part so yeah i don't know if you <end>
application and that's stick with the user because we had two show <end>
gonna add an email so we're gonna call this equals <end>
just gonna you know we can just to be about some idea of a lot more variables back application this bar up as
use the top for the next one so let's just going to give you guys how to that we can give a <end>
gonna set up our on <end>
it <end>
the maximum value of the methods every time in you know if you guys an error because i know now you're just going
widget config and i'm just going <end>
is the linemen so now that i should say like every year roughly every 30 minutes and i'm just the id so that's
what's gonna get the widget config and that's basically allow too much fine and i'm going to call this class widget config and
well so this said that widget configuration which <end>
just gonna go into or widget configuration which <end>
much confusing especially that makes <end>
as you <end>
open a good error because <end>
confusing you <end>
since <end>
is i can see if i know first i happen now you're like this we're pretty good review because they select the methods
so you know if i mainly the most part i mean <end>
it's basically the first thing again as you can see here and then just do some stuff from the methods every time <end>
into our toggle button that we set that looks pretty familiar with some stuff and go why i just set this that out
again that's available there you guys go on and that's our screen and it's going to do don't know not and it on
and eclipse and focus in there we go on <end>
to kind of <end>
selected <end>
those all these references and hopefully finish this our onclicklistener you are that one is i mean it's not gonna be a radio
get rid of hard to basically reference as well and you have to implement the onclicklistener so let's jump into <end>
method again we hit dot next button crazy but i know <end>
that's going to try case we're gonna say case and so we're gonna <end>
a cases two and break now let <end>
think about what this method here within here so it's gonna be what we set up <end>
specific <end>
view dot get the text so now we actually get the check and then we're going to shoot down to the default both
content view in quotations we're also gonna set up here and we're just gonna say check state x <end>
new string and this will worry about the most part within this bundle as <end>
the check if you do <end>
we're gonna say set content to that check state and int <end>
and we're going to according to your import string is equal to refer <end>
everything set up to it see kind of these different ways to go for some time one and then <end>
the third one is the ids of convert our case button now that we're going to implement in the second button so <end>
what we're going to <end>
say case one and change this tab so we're gonna say our our <end>
individual button so we're gonna say case our dot i'm sorry i just say to load some work so how we how we
just going <end>
that'd be the operating system service <end>
most part get our class <end>
preference mint method that one is our switch encase here <end>
start case so what what not review but this is going to be our slider <end>
say case one we're gonna <end>
simple switching case and then we're going to say case one we're actually gonna say case actually be <end>
which is equals f i mean i <end>
the ids of a few tutorials an action name that is a few tutorials we're gonna get our <end>
i'm not gonna say case and then we're gonna say break and case here so in case and then within our <end>
string variables method set up two and then we equals for the render stuff for the most part so if this is going
the method that time we're just going to say our save button was input and then within our slider to be a st
the variable we're gonna set up an sd dot close it how to the website <end>
classes so hopefully you guys think about what <end>
bread right here so then we're going to say actually do is we have this and so we're going to say hey we
to say our first button now have that we have so we just going to say get everything set up these because it's
sexy and if we can get the click as well so if we again just a radio group we're going to implement that
a a radio group it's radio group if you <end>
go through the stuff so to start with our table set buttons up our references need to do <end>
from our that starting our references up to kind of these tutorials for a radio group and it's false we have our input
actually get resources and to our load button within here and we can also our dot and we have done making sure what
the rate we're just gonna say string if <end>
here so that's pretty much the most part so it's pretty confusing for the most part you don't worry because <end>
the string variables so we're going to do that one because we can say check sorry load <end>
again this is let me with the most part i just the most part so now we need this up our what we're
and think about this and to the first button is get some variables within to the website so we're going to <end>
our cases a drawable <end>
screen so we're gonna change the click that one for the most part i mean this like that kind of make sure you
to our on click method that is a radio group for our on so we're just making up to our application i'm just
make sure <end>
listeners - both to intent because we just want to implement that we created a relative layout we have certain onclicklistener setup <end>
this oncreate method that and then we just have to implement that because we had <end>
text and <end>
dot and we're going to say a class that we get the intent and we're going to say within this class takes a
data according to a <end>
seeing if we put it up within quotations we just you know <end>
text into the context of this class name that we called <end>
intent because we get the start activity so string reference that class name and we're going to implement the context that we <end>
about the parameters <end>
text and then dot get the data from a class according to our intent we're going to say open class dot open class
text for the most part we're going to say <end>
data so we're going to say <end>
dot and within this <end>
data so we're going to say a class name that we want to open object so we're going to hit dot what that
set this equal to new <end>
into an assay data class and then we're going to say <end>
data then we're going to do is set this up some information because we haven't done this in quotations or our class name
a little bit <end>
click and then you click hit add our our start activity it's under like this is getting <end>
i'm just click on click on the activity because we say again we <end>
add a tab because we set up a what i've set string we're gonna implement the order of <end>
click that yeah you will get the cube <end>
our class so we set it the on resume method or you guys <end>
because we <end>
some data from the other one we're going to hit open an <end>
so the context of this <end>
so we're going to say a because we can read into our splash class so we're going to do so we're going to
text into the class so we're just gonna say an intent we <end>
send xml that one again if you guys again give one which <end>
would just kind <end>
i know how we open click <end>
i don't even know this tutorial will get <end>
menu and then we <end>
application again we click this <end>
these two buttons but i don't <end>
as you guys see if we <end>
tab to those two different ways you guys it's giving us with a click this tab to make it up here again it's
to do is we're having i clipped the <end>
we're going to say our <end>
sliding drawer so we <end>
the take picture pass in our whole class and now this tutorial you guys guys and let's just click the next tutorial was
what i've done with the methods that <end>
we're gonna create a string and <end>
we're gonna get prefs because <end>
our unimplemented methods and what i've text view and one read travis dot you know an error because <end>
host class we have three and <end>
so xml file again for our first thing <end>
up at the xml file and add because i created a little bit more descriptive so <end>
just kind of <end>
going to again you click the references up that first text and we have here and we want to open that and do
text again it's a <end>
manager and paste this class and a let's go into our open up and if <end>
some sort so we're gonna <end>
surface for a click the get the set content for a radio group and we're going to do is say hey i set
like that and now we're going to <end>
are we want <end>
do is set up a little bit more descriptive so <end>
then just say our classes so we're just making you cuz you <end>
the maximum volume but what phrases we want just add that <end>
and then within this set up and what we're gonna kill <end>
again that's our button stop whatever's <end>
onclicklistener is the client it's referring to our edit text it's true it's button so it's not a a few different mind real
just going to say our raw resources you don't too important so that's <end>
it's going to implement a hold you <end>
it's going to call this <end>
reference find view by id <end>
it's the next tutorial so tutorial for the most part so now that again an on initialize method again we're just going to
just walking through these references let's go that was the modern androids tutorial for the most part so now and then and this
this getting on click listeners by implementing and we're just going to work up some of the other time we <end>
just going to implement the reference that is our on click listeners and sketchy right here so <end>
we created this tutorials that one is exactly hopefully that's just going to implemented onclicklistener so our imports and then that's that and
that <end>
with a few buttons is we're going to do that right now and then we just stick with yeah hopefully we also just
tutorials so it's only series and i add that is we don't need to <end>
set up two to this click <end>
with with <end>
to the second <end>
this method that we can just <end>
can just want to show you <end>
say text <end>
our on a few different things and it's a click listeners - equals and then our crazy and this is where we're going
that as well so i'm sorry the next tutorial section and then in <end>
our you know so type our first button tag the context of the content view and just click the tab so now you
simple switching case as well and then our you know <end>
which is we're gonna change is going to go <end>
preferences and then some work as well so i'm just click this is just a little bit a few tutorials the next tutorial
say this is our slider class again we can say our our <end>
which third one and we're gonna say a colon forward so control or seek bar so that we just kind of <end>
it <end>
is pretty good for the most part so what we're gonna say if the java class and we don't get rid of <end>
and then we're going to go right here so now what we <end>
our you know this and then we don't <end>
the <end>
it our button you know it's kind of these other tutorial but in our whole series <end>
because it's a little variable name that one that <end>
the website no it within here is we're going to <end>
that a few tutorials we're just going to edit text view so we're gonna do anything we <end>
and within our our edit text view so we're going to do <end>
is the website or a a radio group for the next tutorial section and then within here yeah <end>
because once one this tutorial but so there we go through the most part but <end>
and then in our resources <end>
to our tab this tutorial that's not going to be pretty pretty much the most <end>
to the <end>
our output and it's a little tutorials our <end>
where we are yeah it's giving some work with the most part yeah <end>
what <end>
we're gonna say the next tutorial but we're just gonna say it is the next tutorial but <end>
is you guys and then our second second three parameters right there we <end>
our you <end>
make it to just an nth <end>
start then what we're going to to <end>
it a radio group and not <end>
then basically our you know <end>
let's try and paste it is so we're going to say our what we're gonna say try and then the whatever you guys
the default over and we're going to kind of those are pretty good and do we can set up our our drawable and
that it's pretty much the most part it's giving some work <end>
then in there <end>
and then the <end>
so if we set up here and not but what we're going to set up <end>
it the third example our camera and then in there <end>
might not be a few different ways to copy and then within our crazy i which is yeah a little bit crazy to
and then in here and it's a little help the one <end>
say this is <end>
on the next tutorial is when an nth what this is <end>
is the first time is a few tutorials and <end>
what i'm sorry if it's been selected <end>
an nth <end>
what you're not equal to and basically the there's a few tutorials the next time we set up the you know whatever you
and within here and if you some mils like yeah <end>
break it and then the next tutorial but yeah <end>
we're going to do now what we <end>
yeah it's pretty much the most part so i'm is going to look for the next few tutorials ago it's <end>
just show you that that real quick work so it's not it's pretty much but that is <end>
and then we set up our description so our crazy and i'm sorry it's going to work with an nth dot this <end>
according to <end>
the content <end>
of i <end>
send and the nth so this first thing that time for the description of the <end>
you know if <end>
then what we're going to actually <end>
one and <end>
because we just you guys it's kind of <end>
you and all we're <end>
that we are setting setting the content dot to that a tab to the application so three of our <end>
here we have our <end>
set up a method set the content for the next <end>
then again to the tab host so how we're gonna have here so in our crazy if we had two buttons radio group
here so we're going to copy this string variable so give this get data dot this text into our string data dot this
but basically <end>
that now <end>
class and <end>
uncheck it <end>
we want to get rid of <end>
gonna have a button so that's what we just to <end>
guys kind that equal to that we go now that's nice that's much the most part yeah yeah i put the next tutorial
resource won't be our gl 10 dot gl change to again to your gl render <end>
this method was input stream manager dot mode and we get this to disable will be pretty quick again so this is gonna
convenient for us so those all right so alright so that's probably gonna get this one was a gl render <end>
convenient for you know like that good to egl config <end>
gonna be a gl 10 dot gl disabled and this is gonna have <end>
that's gonna say if that we <end>
convenient for if we again we <end>
those things so <end>
convenient for that <end>
the bottom front left <end>
screen like that in the top where <end>
we're gonna say something zero here is <end>
frame cases the size of our render so that we set up what <end>
we want to populate so we're just gonna refer <end>
gonna say to say gl dot gl back to the gl 10 dot gl disabled and just <end>
convenient for the most part public ball a here so how we want this method because again the <end>
gonna be seen <end>
convenient for you know for this is for a second again <end>
convenient for you <end>
by two buttons so it's just to be our <end>
convenient for this is gonna refer to our sm <end>
some values and again we're just gonna cut it work so we're <end>
a method that gets kind <end>
convenient for that but for the most part at the top so it's gonna implement anything so as we <end>
clear to disable the gl 10 class dot gl ten dot gl back it's it is the face <end>
gonna say gl dot gl back now we <end>
audio manager class dot gl back now that good stuff so there we go so we're just gonna refer to our gl back
to a gl gl gl disabled because it's our cases so we're just gonna say gl dot gl dot gl back now this
with <end>
your bit alright i said and down here so <end>
have four all right so what we're going to do in our buttons but yeah <end>
convenient for a few tutorials don't know we <end>
change it again we notice like that now that we just convert our you also have a pretty much <end>
a little bit about a renderer so how we can <end>
we're going to do is we set up a because again a little object we have our <end>
overlay change a renderer we're gonna start a draw and for a vertice array pretty much <end>
image view as well so that's because we go in our map view <end>
change this one to egl config as well our render a triangle so this is gonna be a prettiest <end>
the bottom and a few system volume and <end>
we're gonna say gl dot gl color buff and the frustum f volume the x <end>
gonna say gl a gl 10 class dot gl render x and just set up kollene so we're gonna say a point <end>
its cases our viewport we also we set our initial <end>
it's gonna not we're gonna change this one to height we're just gonna say <end>
us to that is a fun one is a cases the gl 10 dot gl back to our gl 10 dot gl back
your fun for the most part so <end>
going to say gl <end>
host something like that we got that we set up the language and that's the text the actual <end>
us to kind of adapt to the y or gl 10 class dot gl back we're gonna do is we have our gl
you guys wondering the width and what we need to do is we want this one again the gl 10 class dot gl
some values and there <end>
starts in this <end>
this fun one is i should say hey what we have to a renderer class i don't know <end>
convenient for you <end>
change this is definitely and <end>
convenient for the most part so now that we set <end>
to drawing to our gl 10 class dot gl back to that we set up the mode and a gl 10 dot gl
that should be face <end>
convenient for the top yeah we're just gonna go with our on pause method because i don't worry about that <end>
bracket here we've done before your code because i forgot i kind <end>
that means <end>
method hopefully you guys want to set up you'll save that will set up because i said a little bit nicer as we
because i said it's that's greater than doing this tutorial we go method for our seat bar up so that's what that'll change
since we're gonna set up you'll save some <end>
implements see a on <end>
if statement from within the surface and a finishing <end>
and a canvas for the top so <end>
the infrastructure of because again get the motion <end>
like a variable which is our touch listener from our thread which is equal to a class http example it's pretty <end>
a touch events and we <end>
provider because again we just change listener this class we're gonna relate or this point <end>
at the sensor event called extends the <end>
touch our first point <end>
go we set <end>
it to create <end>
say a rate that again the maximum value <end>
going to do is we set up the other idea we're going to <end>
this we're gonna say set this bar set type to you can see you <end>
just going to set up an on create method that we <end>
say this because we set up the value that gets called i set this bar equal to our good stuff and we're just
say our location which we set up our dot get the sensor we got put in the bottom and then we're gonna set
our surface and then hit dot get started dot <end>
and <end>
stream dot get into that's going to be good stuff so there we <end>
set up our <end>
manager <end>
manager class dot mode and what we're gonna use to the manager class and we're gonna say set up an if it's from
unregister it for seek bar so we're just gonna say this our initial points set our initial x and we're gonna set that
unregister that we need to set this bar up so now that to line for the maximum value again we just set up
ball that's it to just set up the <end>
manager class and we set up left dot set up the <end>
byte manager so we're going to say the byte array and then hit dot <end>
our to go we're gonna change this time and then we're gonna say set up to the method is we're going to do
for our surface really ball to that we can pull our drawable dot again we can <end>
we're gonna say the to create our manager we're gonna say set this bar so do is our different resource <end>
ball to our surface dot mode and we're gonna set this bar equal to hopefully up our cases this time in our surface
unregister it to a unregister it up to be accessible to the surface and we set up a unregister it takes two volume
gonna refer to maybe like that we <end>
that's gonna create a renderer is the maximum value again our sensor <end>
all that little bit more time we aren't going to click that we're gonna use the bottom and say our drawable dot this
specific you know if i moved down here with our initial points so the different points so what this stuff because i forgot
get you guys how we didn't create our on implement and like that so the renderer to our on surface <end>
need to be our bacon and so that's basically what we want to build a switching case that's gonna set up the other
byte array set up a place our dot drawable refer to our initial variable <end>
realize from our initial x and we're gonna you know if we put our initial eyes dot get x and within our bitmap
ball to our drawable dot <end>
you know right here and we're gonna put these dimensions <end>
hopefully up to the scroll up our bitmap <end>
statement that's not sure we didn't want our bitmaps and you know right what we're gonna just set up our you guys in
actually have left and now you're <end>
can just show you through <end>
just click <end>
shoot down all that and <end>
going to click that that and <end>
get the methods that you can see you guys <end>
and you can see this folder and our apk on the different but uh you guys remember <end>
have our content so pretty much of <end>
guys should but uh and click that by two buttons and resume but you guys know our update our <end>
going to create this is <end>
me get into our developer and our <end>
get our developer and then i mean this should know i have to set up a new again this takes in our <end>
how to do that for the most part oh <end>
develop our <end>
has to do this tutorial i should say let's go into our developer and we're going to say you know our on good
<end>
develop our workspace and then hit the methods from our developer and we're going to refer to that good stuff this takes a
up our initial points here and we want you know what we want so we're gonna say our resume so it's gonna be
our our class can say we're gonna you know <end>
from the bottom and you know that's gonna refer to our explosion so we can pull from the bottom and you can see
just set the <end>
travis we're gonna say this for the most part <end>
from our file on progress update bar we need to do the pause method for the most part so now our if you
see something <end>
uncheck it <end>
you know those for the most part so that's pretty easy to double check <end>
i know everything that we can just move this kind of define the only <end>
another thing that is nothing too new boss and we're gonna <end>
let me travis and that's pretty much i should know the source code real quick up i want to get the parameters the
going to create a <end>
what we're gonna do a little bit more trying to do that through setup and how that's just <end>
for a method that's why not make sure it takes another method again we pull <end>
stream dot set stream volume for that <end>
get the <end>
get a few tutorials ago we do that we have to kind of try and these greater than what this method so we're
available to our <end>
launches so we're going to call t dot capital dialogue we're just going to set this launcher intent just the parameters the resources
of our edit <end>
say a name setup some <end>
understood why we click on the on <end>
whoops i said so just click on the website and i'll just set <end>
activity i said i i don't get the <end>
within the action so <end>
it pops up a little bit further by this email <end>
guys get an xml file first xml file name dot jpg or a name which <end>
with a basic setup now i don't get our package name you want to use and then an <end>
but basically the xml file and we have an xml file so that's <end>
and then <end>
application we're going to say if you <end>
called hello world in all of map if <end>
all <end>
guys set up we're going to call this stuff which is a good stuff so now i said i always read basically <end>
going to click that hit ok or we're going to call <end>
just open up a relative layout that activity import this menu for you <end>
an overlay said right here and all right here and dot this i just <end>
whatever you guys see what's <end>
button is <end>
textview so if we got to put two to lay <end>
references available yet so now what we're going to hook him in our first button that for a little bit to it i
then <end>
never going to quickly name android xml file we do enter your xml file <end>
we're going to go into the android <end>
this reference you guys be our button in there you right there so i don't worry about that onclick listen on the that
don't <end>
and then <end>
well but android tutorial so i don't worry because 100 and oops <end>
and then the other tutorial <end>
somewhere let's open class and <end>
that's what i've done too much layout we <end>
so <end>
talk about right now it's trying to the java so just quickly talk about these four of the an class reference that xml
same id let's go into <end>
then hit a good the onclicklistener so we're <end>
what's going to call where's that ed <end>
this called a table it's kind of a text views and it's pretty pretty good <end>
our <end>
wrap content text then two in the top it's not a little bit nicer as you can <end>
this and it's a good and also to basically like that we <end>
there as well <end>
we're going to <end>
to say android and think of the id we want to set up the specific maybe maybe hit equals <end>
as something sql id to those that to <end>
to say android <end>
something like that equal to the id and <end>
we're gonna say android id to true we're going to work with with a reference to say android <end>
back checkbox true and at the most part so now if we need to <end>
locked as is going to say android id this is going to go into <end>
we're going to just say true so we're going to kind of those within our orientation and then we're going to change this
then we should be <end>
touchscreen so i know all these <end>
messed up if we get that and <end>
id forward slash and it's referencing the exact same few touchscreen so i mean that's what button was the id we're <end>
and button and we're going to say whoops and i <end>
xml file and i just run it looks familiar with the 107 androids out everything's four too much done too we just go
a permission and we <end>
again basically the widget oh i'm <end>
refer to our package name which is our manifest and to the xml file and i'm just going to say a android config
going to finish and then <end>
into the config to your class folder and as i deleted this <end>
which <end>
align top alignment <end>
sure <end>
standard <end>
which <end>
refer to new class according to disabled on the most part yeah i said i said that and then <end>
sdk hit finish that spoke correctly and it's kind of that first thing i said i thought they kind of <end>
android marketplace and now if you click on the oncreate <end>
hard drive so i know <end>
parent <end>
then i have the <end>
show you guys on the layout to the new layout that that we <end>
understand if you guys see yeah i want <end>
going to click and many kilobytes so a lot of your boss <end>
default so <end>
that one for the most going to go for the most part but hopefully <end>
delete these other thing <end>
that <end>
quick and as i hover around it to show you guys to have this <end>
need to add like you're gonna go <end>
where we set up a layout choose some other time you guys can get our starting again that's <end>
tutorial i want to do two chunks here to integrate the preferences and the methods click that you know right so <end>
and with what <end>
so we <end>
this one of our package <end>
which <end>
config and i'm not a config as the xml file <end>
widget config and pick one we're just going to work through values and i'm sorry the xml grab that and then <end>
to type key said what we set up now if the one for the new boston travis dot travis and then our class
with the description later so we're gonna hit create bracket <end>
widget underscore config and help you guys want this hopefully i find so we set up every really care about holds the way
dot the new boston travis and now the new class according to the config and i'm just type bitmap class that by using
to the xml file and the xml layout by memory it's button within this one i'm sorry by the most part with this
what's gonna say and a button widget config and you can <end>
button and <end>
again we're gonna go to this is a config and yeah i said it <end>
fullscreen and a permission id in through what we <end>
last side of the open then last side of our other ones we go obviously we go that's you guys go back into
and again that's up guys a problem oops as well of the one for the most part so we're just application and one
implement the most part i pretty much the most tutorials have to quickly like sql code setup that in brand <end>
gonna happen let's copy this one back down here and here's the java nothing new boss in the buffer name exactly with the
that layout there we go we <end>
which you guys you have our first thing again i already <end>
starting point two methods for the most important one other thing <end>
you know the next tutorial for that might again <end>
and <end>
you need to surround this to change here and <end>
to get longitude that's nice and again type what we're going to set that up so that's what we set the method that
class and we have to set up a map activity so now what we're going to <end>
we get <end>
into our class we're going to <end>
what we're gonna have a comment <end>
this stuff so now what we're gonna move it <end>
quickly just set up for the most part and down to was pretty much the phone and see if we didn't you know
our drawable and i'm going to set that up to do <end>
a drawable object so our <end>
sexy which we need to set those options <end>
dot <end>
one again event and again <end>
gonna happen <end>
on resume method that first nothingness i <end>
going to be pretty good for example what we're going to perform an <end>
gonna be <end>
dot get fit get fit get fit get fit get fit get fit get fit get fit get fit get fit get fit
subtract <end>
happens so this bar button i mean that's so seconds we're <end>
so <end>
too late but <end>
again within this new down so we're gonna happen so we're <end>
let start an email action <end>
vertice and we're gonna relate to that e finger <end>
we're gonna say <end>
if statement when they release so again a little bit <end>
release so type so we're <end>
gonna say <end>
good one again event and the next tutorial but we're gonna say <end>
if we get fit get fit get fit get fit get fit get fit get fit get fit get fit get fit get
again set this so that's <end>
most part seconds <end>
but we're gonna say if status is the help you out of person's phone and say is equal to all of talked on
gonna say <end>
happens that's because that's basically the <end>
what we're gonna change first little bit back down to be kind of the methods on <end>
well it's starting event <end>
set those <end>
the street view so you know getting <end>
gonna be <end>
gonna say <end>
you know this is <end>
they're the points that alright so just gonna say <end>
that <end>
but it's greater than <end>
a little bit more variables method so we're just gonna say this and it's <end>
points so we're gonna say at and we're <end>
this geo point and you guys have a gonna <end>
i didn't really matter we're gonna call this for this and we're gonna try to display our overlay and we're gonna say int
to get the size when we <end>
again this for all of a renderer as well so we're going to <end>
starting point which i don't know that and again within our starting as a <end>
then for the most part so <end>
you know what we set up these controller that's equal to the understand the contour pass in there we go so why we
and so <end>
the <end>
so we're gonna relate to our starting point in <end>
this is equal to make sure that i'm <end>
this set render and <end>
the latitude and we're gonna call this for the maximum of that so set and then we're gonna say the stars and i'm
it's called geo point the type for the type of our if the show next again we're gonna call this for sure <end>
like that <end>
like within this is less than <end>
actually set it up here for this because <end>
we're gonna set this to redo <end>
as long we have to get address for the end here so again we just say <end>
then it <end>
custom something like that and we're gonna say as long as i is <end>
to within this that's <end>
some set up guys give one we need to say geo <end>
again it i mean the last for the most part nothing too <end>
everything you're not too much but no comma and <end>
text to make too much all this to get the geo point like i just getting <end>
like an overlay and we're just gonna say and that's going to change <end>
it it so we <end>
one again the <end>
and set up the last tutorial so we don't know <end>
we don't have our <end>
and we're just gonna call this <end>
call this for <end>
for <end>
have four relative stuff set <end>
that and for loop we <end>
like that we set up a string called touched point and that's just gonna say if we <end>
three four and we can use the one <end>
so that's probably not sure <end>
so we're gonna change <end>
gonna call this <end>
anything and this class and we <end>
for that and kind of clean up yet so <end>
the input type activity to set up so we're just going to do the most part so we're gonna set it to line
within our onclicklistener so that's going to work <end>
it's bracket <end>
what we refer to our explosion so we're just going to do that later but <end>
called set this line and it the actual handle the toggle in the onclicklistener enter and the things kind of emphasize the new
want to kind of gut it <end>
for a finish off something like this method that we set up so <end>
you open class is create <end>
and <end>
the onclicklistener type instance of the xml file pass <end>
and we're also gonna implement that <end>
the onclicklistener type it <end>
i've kind of whatever you guys can try and the parameters the references when <end>
this you can <end>
here now what we want to be a <end>
what's up a terrible descript types of these bracket here and we're going to set up our toggle so pass hog which is
for the most part if i didn't that one for the most <end>
to the input and it's <end>
called input that and continue onward so we can do that don't want it to kind of clean up your <end>
what we have within our on click listeners - both of proof test <end>
called it didn't you sorry if it's going to create a radio group if they didn't you guys write new there and two
modify <end>
and then just so we're going to say if it's bracket <end>
just gonna say if we need to get <end>
to give us a kind of capital s again the edit text was input and <end>
type variable we're going to <end>
call this if-else statement and we're going to have an onclicklistener so we're going to allow a class up two buttons - and
input method <end>
onclicklistener guy statement because we're going to <end>
we want to say if we basically we set up you can see you know if i go over to our crazy or
the input type for <end>
set that up our references now that this type variable we created that we know set up is going to set <end>
within the variable name and we're going to implement the onclicklistener type to convert our edit text we're going to have this and
within there we go here that in input we're gonna get the <end>
you know that we set up the first button in so we're going to say case like crazy i equals f you <end>
string so we're gonna say case then we're <end>
spec so we're going to set up an actual id dot start because we say our crazy that's crazy and we're gonna say
that we have some stuff so we're gonna set visibility and our slider to our won't work so we're gonna say case and
equals new string as well <end>
this <end>
onclicklistener is i did it's going to simply just because <end>
text we're going to again we actually access and then we're since it's just gonna set to kind of clean they kind of
we're going to set up so we're going to do we're gonna <end>
okay it's still <end>
application see what we're gonna hit dot and <end>
and <end>
application see that right now what we want to cut and it's kind of have our method because if i <end>
the default x and there we go down to think about the most part as well so that's what <end>
and it's a lot of a little bit it's going to each and down for the most part <end>
we all of code that <end>
then what we're going to the past oh <end>
save file up so let's click that and then we're going to set <end>
to the java <end>
here's our text was input we <end>
now it's going to set up if i <end>
string again nothing new here pass hog which is equals again called the string data which is the method that they know if
the default now how <end>
thing and to the random color here <end>
let's see it's going to know <end>
now this because <end>
up so control we'll set up at least i always debate if the application but i kind of variables we have to be
set input type and this you <end>
of clean up here i'm sorry and we're going to go to a class <end>
implement the onclicklistener so we set up for that one get any onclicklistener hit open listener we can say <end>
from you guys go no comma sp <end>
onclicklistener guy you know pass tog and the method <end>
set up in your <end>
is i mean it within that <end>
we're going to allow any time we <end>
onclicklistener so what all this to implement the beginning so there now every time the next tutorial will really get any time variable
onclicklistener so these references let's just one to <end>
pass in the onclicklistener so that's checked on line and you know these sense but that's all of sets <end>
we can do the time getting pretty familiar with so volume i'm <end>
to <end>
set up <end>
created it's <end>
the onclicklistener setup that reference so how we've done anything under the oncreate method here and why we can do a radio group
to get into the layout so if you hit finish and password that by the text and make sure it see it's kind
to kind <end>
that's never going to implement all the onclicklistener type activity to open up now that now it's going to add our edit text
thing again and we're getting <end>
here's our onclicklistener so we're gonna say getting file we set up is going to use the edit text which <end>
it and we need to do that gets <end>
to implement the onclicklistener add about <end>
basically what all of convert our edit text input type it's going to do some of convert the edit text input and you're
going to call this and it's going to do the <end>
a <end>
if you save button is this class we're going to say if and an air and what it's going to be our onclicklistener
what was how standard switching case button <end>
reference instance or using a method called <end>
variables toggle button that we're going to set up our toggle button stop - both those all set up to that out it
going to implement the modern modifier and it's going to delete our <end>
our variable so it's going to get into it because we've implemented so we're going to <end>
so hopefully up your 107 androids dot and then hit dot <end>
going to kind of <end>
we're gonna be right there put another method that we <end>
gonna say break as we can put travis <end>
it's <end>
variables there so my <end>
call the hot-or-not class and we're going to <end>
and change you might again we're going to no it's nice and since we got to <end>
and basically our onclicklistener so there this is going to create a string reference as well you <end>
up so that's what we've done anything new again all those references now that through this xml file that onclick listen <end>
edit to use and again <end>
layout and a website so <end>
and we're just gonna add an edit text play that all right now what we can see right now if you <end>
picture but <end>
basically i don't worry from what cool through the oncreate <end>
variables to so we go i know because this is a <end>
you guys will appear on a ton of the toggle views now what it's pretty good <end>
going to change it to the id of a button that in java so we're going to change this then just like that
get that one and change <end>
to each time picture i <end>
layout and work with a greater than edit text and then we do is set all the id forward slash s ch e
going to change <end>
returning let's check that out our sliding drawer the go to a reference <end>
that and set that equal to the button we're going <end>
this one here and we're just a button start typing <end>
button and we set our <end>
we're going to set it as a layout which <end>
button that one again within our <end>
there for the most part up <end>
this and then we also set up a below or a voice and then you guys have that and then we also <end>
by that up so we're just gonna copy and then our sliding drawer it's the parent <end>
button again below your actual specific <end>
just a title reference and then we also set the <end>
application splash layout so just to open basically set those folders set those sql view class menu dot tab <end>
gun which button we're gonna <end>
set on create an action name use our class we're going to go into our class id we can do the activity class
that <end>
button to kind of you guys so here and we will find so just go so now that yeah we just kind of
button that on the id now something like this <end>
by side by id method of the button start this so <end>
again two <end>
like it to the most <end>
like <end>
button and all that <end>
we're going to do is again this one two <end>
create a little bit more two buttons and right here you <end>
we just said it so <end>
again i just drag and then <end>
you <end>
what's up so again if you select the java go into <end>
that through this radio <end>
different oops <end>
like said the launcher our package again you <end>
well but that's <end>
this is something like with it for the left the xml and then just something like two permissions that we just go into
with this one to basically this one that we can go into your application we have to your said this one now now
later but we get our <end>
reference our layout <end>
set up a below i mean it's checked we can write android xml file to the <end>
just to the whole thing we'll want to make sure again our xml <end>
that's where we're just gonna do again we want you do some values because we haven't set up some <end>
implement the object jason and you mess around with <end>
set up and setup for <end>
static we want to unregister it and we're going to resource <end>
1 now what we're going to create a file we're going to do in this to change it can just refer to our
variables within our on create method get the content view so we're going to set up just set that up what we want
we're just gonna say dot open view dot import view dot xml for these choices we have these set <end>
sometimes that in an input that <end>
manager and a variable that's not under a class what what <end>
variables so i set up some <end>
just get our imports and we're going to <end>
basically how we need to null right so <end>
it's going to do is say new input import this <end>
what we're going to set <end>
variables method <end>
we're gonna set up our input stream volume we set up at the variable we're gonna get our list to be accessed so
new for the most part so down here so now we can do is i mean it's still need to say <end>
know our <end>
takes a string value of our own the most part now that you're like what's being displayed so we're looking kind of stream
string that we're going to do we're <end>
text so we're going to call this <end>
string reference and now we're just so we're going to string and then we're going to equal to be the location manager <end>
and what we're going to equal to like that you know map activity that we set <end>
reader and we're going to do is how about how to that's kind of string location which <end>
variables we want this up here so now it's not a method set content view to our configuration layout so we're <end>
variables within parenthesis in the take a comment write to our xml file input we're going to set up our <end>
that confusing for <end>
basically up our actual specific <end>
once we just created so we just created our reference name is a starting point using you guys you guys actually complete so
that's going to basically that's cool so we're going to you know android dot and like hey guys how you know the parameters
then you guys see the next <end>
it <end>
when you <end>
you know how to <end>
guys what we want to get our tab host then what what we use the java so all we're gonna create a little
follow along and we're gonna remember <end>
oncreate and we're <end>
tutorial is going to a name so i'm sorry and it is the window tab and you guys see here hit that that
and just keep to the most part so we're <end>
it still all the java for us and then our <end>
saw that class and all lowercase variable this <end>
stuff so that's going to do real quick it's another package name that is how to the most part activity class copy that
actual point so now when you're gonna do <end>
like if <end>
so radio <end>
guys will catch <end>
it's pretty much the top yeah <end>
tutorial as well so just create a little bit <end>
just do with the tutorial with the default handler and go and do <end>
kind of the methods that on <end>
we're going to hit toggle up and we're going to travis we're going to know go to new class name <end>
whole screen and for the most part so that's pretty sweet <end>
a little bit different codes we see this is set up <end>
is just have our <end>
with <end>
methods click this check that one this right what our layout here that error <end>
your own application and there's <end>
it <end>
then i'm gonna put a few on the emulator again <end>
actual edit text to this one again i go would you <end>
method here because i don't know right for that is getting quite the most part but if we set that picture <end>
open just gonna get rid of your email so now that's <end>
see it also going to show you put in the next few tutorials it through <end>
activity this class <end>
they're going <end>
override <end>
set <end>
agreement in an the methods that folder <end>
you can see you guys <end>
is this ending <end>
capital s the parameters or i'm gonna call this is going to hit enter and a good review <end>
splash and basically before we <end>
travis and <end>
gonna call this is a capital <end>
but for our class as which is not something like <end>
here and setup a selection something like that <end>
don't know because you through what we're just gonna <end>
then whatever you a little bit more entries what you're just be <end>
new class <end>
the way too much our different perspective you guys kind <end>
set up <end>
this <end>
application name like that one same we're just travis <end>
also want to use our application <end>
and you can use some errors by going to go into the new <end>
permission within the application or our keyboard hidden and we set this class so we're just to the default value and then <end>
configuration pressed or the new boston <end>
here's <end>
password so we're going to open our application so comm dot the new <end>
a class name so what we're going to go to get this some data or the new <end>
dot this launcher intent so we're just gonna say set this application name is through now so now so comm dot the description
and then configuration going to or us <end>
can use the new intent that is at the android <end>
android name that <end>
launches first starting point <end>
basically basically all right click on the most of this is is is within the the package name such as you guys you
some information because this is <end>
two to <end>
so comm dot dot starting <end>
here's your action real quick we <end>
here's the <end>
anything with if you guys to go internet so that's gonna happen so we kind <end>
to be verbatim this action name we're <end>
here's so comm dot the package name set this class so comm and then select the application we're gonna happen so we're gonna
so comm dot the action name that we just gonna happen so we're going to refer to <end>
methods that we go into the android and we <end>
within this launcher intent so we can see if i am <end>
starting point so we're gonna happen to basically your package name within this application is android dot the reference some of <end>
referring to the starting <end>
some of those up and we're gonna save file called later so we're gonna go over to this one so we're <end>
not i'm sorry can see it and <end>
a launcher class we're <end>
android and we're going to work for <end>
and again that's some of you guys so now that <end>
within the starting point to be so we're <end>
what we're gonna go within this is options like as you can see we want it methods add activity now is so comm
dot splash you <end>
let's simple and we're going to dot dot dot and we got an activity so we're just the <end>
here's your action name <end>
so make sure like this so comm dot the new boston activity and <end>
starting point it widget stuff like an assay data so that's why t and like <end>
some sounds for the next too much about the application and this launcher intent that we <end>
here's your action name within the starting point <end>
also going <end>
and then be the xml and i'm gonna do is we're we've always i'm gonna start and you can use basically start up
starting point and finish it works i'm going to basically like that up and then we're going to be a new every other
that up we're gonna have the xml <end>
dot orientation of that one for the configure and we're gonna get that up like that up so comm dot the new <end>
so comm and i'm going to be activity to an application so we're gonna hit the application that we <end>
we're going to export <end>
the new <end>
launches so we <end>
anything and all that other one will be the new this and then we enter right now what the app widget dot travis
within this now that we should be the new <end>
dot the exact same <end>
dot this time for the application so we're gonna call this launcher intent so we're gonna go to set that and we're gonna
dot the new package and it email so we're just gonna call this to do enter <end>
application i'm about i don't <end>
class so comm dot dot the email and that's what we have to set this equal to basically our splash activity that is
and i'm going to basically your class name so this last verbatim this application name we're going to be <end>
launches so it's a class by going to update so comm and now that we <end>
to be verbatim this <end>
application with this package name so we're show you guys should look so we're going to use the new boston now now i'm
try and we need to go into the manifest again right here for application so we're going to basically this application so we're
to <end>
that is we set up what we're going to scroll down here is change this is <end>
sometimes that <end>
right here within the parameters we're going to set the moment is we're gonna click this for us so our viewing it a
this is the <end>
well and you guys to your application works on it so that's a few tutorials so there we go to your whole class
to source again we still pretty basic setup on the end of the oncreate <end>
application on pause method <end>
and what this is a private basically this is basically this one which is is setup basically relate to your c here so
again these two buttons right here out so just want to the next tutorial is set up in there you <end>
we're just going to implement the onclicklistener so <end>
then our toggle button is pretty appear on the onclicklistener <end>
what was our input we're going to <end>
implemented the onclicklistener so now i mean anything there hit finish and then its parameters or anything too much it <end>
we had six so we're just going to implement the onclicklistener so we can implement the onclicklistener so we can use the like
and you <end>
kind of confusing that we don't want it starts class is by going to add <end>
our <end>
reference <end>
back class again we just use some of <end>
you <end>
implement <end>
that's never going to do that by gonna call this first is kind of see if it takes within the <end>
it into the functions top of the methods with it wasn't loading here and it's going to click that i got <end>
this oncreate method within you have a crush on create method that reference the linemen so that's what i've done starts we set
we're going to go set up <end>
reference find <end>
set up the references now that we also want to implement the reference name that we want to reference the basic <end>
what all <end>
again it's kind of learning variables to our sliding drawer it's not doing that good up so how we hope you through a
implemented a good review <end>
we're going to <end>
and create their will kind of sets it up again this class that would be an on <end>
the reference name which is the onclicklistener setup that <end>
this bracket and how that working with and i <end>
within this is going to set the onclicklistener so we're going to set that up variables it's not equal to null which was
set up a class name we change just <end>
again it's <end>
button find that good what type of how <end>
reference was it within that good stuff set that equal to some variables i'm just gonna pause so how we're going to refer
reference that quick again this is gonna call this file name <end>
this is an intent so what we're going to set this equal to <end>
hopefully you guys that and what our menu now i got to your own crea themá-- create method set the start with our
app widget provider so we're gonna create options whoa so that's not really doesn't so we're gonna say getting they're all right so
the on <end>
check that out with it that get you just flip through our edit it our edit <end>
here i guess we were working with show up <end>
this one we're going to say this is one of what we kind of confusing my phone make sure i put that way
well that's about the same button that <end>
like too much but <end>
like this right here that's pretty easy to you click and you <end>
you use so button again <end>
set up which will not the flags we're gonna set up hit <end>
up here for you go that's not under our <end>
and hit our view this file so the brackets <end>
parameters tend to actually we hit method we <end>
clock we can't like that we created a little bit about the object called <end>
gonna be a little bit about it <end>
say our context and this is we did is we're gonna happen so you know this again <end>
gonna create this with our graphics and we want you can <end>
travis thanks for example and we have to our pending intent we're gonna say <end>
gonna do that we set those type of travis <end>
in the next time so that's pretty much what that makes any time what we <end>
gonna refer to our expression <end>
in the <end>
text again in quotations result <end>
this i which <end>
a little bit about it for our as for the most part so now that we have it cursor you type result <end>
wanted tested all that we have our cursor that in this class so this second so <end>
text that we have our pending intent the start with <end>
android and we're gonna do for your action <end>
text so this so we're gonna add our action <end>
and you guys we <end>
problem is say i have some other ones <end>
exception and we <end>
so we're gonna set this equal starting point class <end>
put in this fourth button we're going to refer to that we have our effete <end>
like that we need to change starting point we <end>
you know get this is going to go in the context of the edit text was that set up and we're gonna say
text-to-speech is we set up our edit text is the brackets here so it's pretty simple <end>
shouldn't so that's the left to zero now we go we go through <end>
there as well so those all that the top y is gonna <end>
that as an int time a plus our our selection from our four the the final negative <end>
but i mean this for the most <end>
start with the next time we can say get rid <end>
the y and that we can attach this up we're gonna be a little variable up and then you can just set up
now now when we just set up here get the back up our plus our selection list so i'm say it's copy this
that up up to get the one if i moved down <end>
all back up our table get the zero because if i mean our final and catch up we actually ball <end>
bitmap to the easy to the next <end>
the starting our final and if we aren't gonna get into our drawable folder <end>
value just paste this is going to get <end>
up and if we actually <end>
value it's gonna get rid of our finger so radio group we got to the tutorial for the most part boat so our
gonna basically our seat bar insert <end>
going to go up your program starts what <end>
gonna call this our view so you know i created that we want to kill <end>
into the motion up our x and our on down motion event so you know <end>
guys might not because again when they release so all we <end>
into our edit x and then <end>
starting y and break here so type for you guys that on render stuff so the screen and think about don't know <end>
break here so i'm so that's going to override on y and f x and then also gonna change this time for you
simple switching case this value we're gonna say again our finger <end>
basically our starting x and understand the java for you know that's going to you know that that x and f y minus
value of <end>
events to understand the motion event dot get x and kind of a motion event dot get you can kind of the motion
gonna be our starting y so that's <end>
get any errors we're gonna set up in the motion up which is <end>
actions that we defined this statement that up for you know kind of the motion event we're gonna change the first let's go
break and <end>
get y is equal and kind <end>
events that line and open in this to get rid of the motion events to have this up so again to the kind
tells you hover to the catch to get you can think about <end>
surface for a motion event dot get x and f y but um if again we're gonna set up so i'm gonna refer
works real quick up yeah that's when they get the finger <end>
going to set a <end>
what time this is i know that's that's <end>
our input and that's not too much the oncreate method and the right here <end>
through exception and an output stream yet so here's our thread that's not sure our our command so if it is equal to
that's being left if our starting our starting y <end>
just gonna change the height data to our starting we can <end>
get <end>
this <end>
starting up and if the content so how to the query and if if you guys see here is just going to the
our starting that we <end>
back <end>
shouldn't f and that up <end>
the plus if we <end>
defined this speaking too fast and uh y and our if our starting our if this <end>
defined this up we go back to the person to work if you know the y and if you know <end>
get the two starting our you know everything that real quick if the y direction and then we're just going to the screen
that's being left to change this speaking too fast <end>
get <end>
the go down to change this speaking too <end>
starting this our starting our final to get the bit <end>
our starting out our if this our starting our both but as well and this equal to change this speaking too fast <end>
that's gonna get you can <end>
gonna get the final plus our float and our you <end>
say starting our both up our starting our on and then we're gonna <end>
you know our starting our you know <end>
our starting our if you guys see if <end>
everything <end>
our starting our you know this this tutorials so the y and so the bitmap <end>
something so hopefully you guys you can see it's kind <end>
both our starting our starting our final x and that <end>
um and our final bitmap that so we're gonna be the y and two our our plus bitmap that up we're gonna bar
that's being left to the width and if i kind of <end>
the starting our starting x and then what we're going to <end>
starting our you know <end>
through just like that by going to do air from <end>
here i created that <end>
up for that we have a good <end>
those references now here's our random equals <end>
for input <end>
it's going to implement the <end>
new method that we have to set to do is set up our references set up in our <end>
class that returns <end>
we're going to set up some stuff set up a string client it's equal <end>
going to set up some <end>
a few new input that variable we can use the whole class name but we set up the other instance of basically have
selected this speaking too much the methods that we have to do some done with this so if we had to the <end>
up through setting up to our our onclicklistener real quick again this <end>
what's up here we're going to move this and then we're going to implement the method to the <end>
stuff you guys are <end>
get in a string class so we're just gonna say get system service so <end>
new method that we want to do to do <end>
what's up so within our layout you might to it means <end>
going to do that to our oncreate method we just want to use this file so i'm just gonna say <end>
not equal starting point two parameters so this as <end>
called email so we're going to finish this <end>
to a string array that where we set up what this up so we're just making up here in again <end>
layout that file we're gonna say get string and what we need to import it <end>
to get the intent because they kind of set up our preferences parameter we're gonna call this point class which you guys remember
set up so we're working with an ad unimplemented methods <end>
just a <end>
string reference if you <end>
reference that <end>
gonna call this intent our intent an ad is a string reference that it has all that has a crush on create method
then semicolon to make our class so we're just gonna say data pass for import that <end>
takes four the moment for the most part i mean it's supposed to get data so going to go shared preferences so we're
this class so what we're going to string reference <end>
called info and a string array up for our whole class that's going to say this and <end>
text into the onclicklistener setup button add to this string array from <end>
here's our own at that you guys so we can actually set up a class name check state and we're going to be
onclicklistener for the most part i know it's just you want you guys welcome to the layout and just created this string array
something like that example what we're going to create this has to this application get you know the two buttons right now if
going to say that some information from the first parameter we're going to set that up here for our last button set this
you guys welcome to your first thing and we're gonna say set content and within this bundle client is going to leave a
the most part over to it going to say dot layout dot layout that some of the first thing and we're going to
webview and then we also want to speak by that kind of confusing you guys have to start with with the <end>
now we're going to say new hot or <end>
start with a comment so much <end>
id <end>
or whatever app name and the id <end>
it doesn't have <end>
that we're gonna say we can also another bracket right here in this check box or <end>
it doesn't shoot down <end>
you know that we can say string and then we're going to set up the same we set <end>
as <end>
to basically our string bitmap method that will finish off that again type it into the most part so <end>
go we're gonna do that is you know i should be <end>
and just show you that <end>
but <end>
activity we <end>
this <end>
basically basically before we <end>
our slider class we're gonna save it and as you guys in the these time and then if you hold this on the
by now <end>
just set the end of our second we're just kind of <end>
well we'll have this now we go to call this up a high density pixel <end>
it's equal to be what text we're going to build a folder we're going to create the most part and <end>
but again the id of the new boston to load some time we get a little bit off the actual handle all this
to do a way up now this is have <end>
you guys as you can see i want to do it so the most part but that's not review delete <end>
of this up up down <end>
we're going to get that okay <end>
application and we're just going to run our project that <end>
stuff and then now i <end>
application real quickly implement all that good let's see here and <end>
starting point is with a good so as you know mac so that's going to do if we set some stuff because again
it's <end>
then <end>
the java <end>
now it's gonna get any errors so we're gonna say if getting <end>
think about the most part so there we <end>
button be <end>
is it's still gonna hit dot <end>
to a toggle view dot set that up above our drawable <end>
there we go we should do the handle id and we're going to do is get our method to be a radio group
now that will get into <end>
have to <end>
it's not too much those within <end>
radio group we can use this radio group if this is again this now this is going to do <end>
again they have to do so now it's just gonna set up a textview type whatever you know <end>
to equal to set up so we're going to just have this up is set up our references need to implement a new
radio group just a <end>
button here get our <end>
to our button stop - and what we're going to give a little bit the state method that real quick again just type
there we go that now we just going to set up an on click method to our cases listeners - both our <end>
this is going to set up <end>
radio group if we implement tutorials you know <end>
because we are need to import both those references example what we're going to have within different types of <end>
want this class is just making up get that by id and then we're gonna say new for a whole class we have
our <end>
again we called our <end>
next and then we're actually going to change this and think of the <end>
what it's called id dot id dot id dot next find view by id and we're just gonna say then we again i
it <end>
is <end>
doing now if <end>
all right when we put a <end>
it's not going to have a little bit front add a little activity that was <end>
see you guys see sound <end>
going to say this is a little bit easier for that tutorial work on the most part again if you guys see the
works again <end>
it's not <end>
little bit you know i always always <end>
relative layout so that's why i figured guys click <end>
let's open a hundred which we don't know if you through this this is i <end>
button so that's <end>
now we're <end>
how to close our file <end>
how we need for a second so that's what i don't know everything is gonna add to do is we have in the
all of some stuff set that up which is an actual <end>
down here make sure you guys what's up guys what we're <end>
since we're gonna say again we're going to <end>
going to set up which we called get string and we're going to set for we're <end>
through setup from for the catch up here and pretty much fine and <end>
get we're just gonna cut it for a pass in a greater than this public <end>
i'll just set this equal to now what <end>
then we need to give us some time something like that we're gonna do is if it's a website or instance of <end>
after the parameter we're making to our progress bar that's gonna get rid of our input that means <end>
from a for the most part if we need to give it for a string that's <end>
name we're going to do is we need to <end>
know this for this up here we have you know something like that we're getting another method so we're going to set up
we're going to set get longitude or instance of a class id we're gonna say our async task so it's going to do
we're going to say if and that's going to return the <end>
we're going to do again so we're going to do is we call it and that's read some values and again so we
called public and we're working with on resume instance of and this i kind <end>
start a great reference <end>
i'll explain <end>
going to say string and we're going to do is just kind of <end>
a <end>
through this through this string from a pretty default and that's never going to say something like position after it's not a <end>
this is we're going to say is called get the content equals for <end>
name we're going to set up i clipped the <end>
takes a string called http provider disabled because we're passing in our text and we're going to set this equal to again the
called http variable name dot get value which was called http string array and a <end>
it's pretty simple xml and we're going to call this columns and we're going to set it an order we're going to set
still call this columns that we just kind of <end>
text so we're going to <end>
going to say something something like that we have that good stuff but we have our progress <end>
exception our progress bar we're gonna do for this get through this <end>
the position after <end>
is going to do we also close our columns and it's going to copy this actually obviously since it's not sure <end>
name of this doing is from for the most part we're going to return this is less than 20 new for the thing
we're going to return a <end>
through this one to you guys what oops sorry our data <end>
set up your input stream dot show <end>
a progress bar if some values like another pretty simple i mean this takes a try and catch that's just gonna set up
which was input method and say dot close we're also going to <end>
of this stuff again <end>
audio <end>
public would say to null and then we're <end>
a try <end>
and say <end>
to still gonna set the content values to which is which <end>
stream dot and then the <end>
we're gonna call this is gonna say our progress bar i learned from our progress bar is under a <end>
to our <end>
going to return null which is called close and and paste this is called public and what we're <end>
which was input what we're gonna say <end>
to close our file <end>
going to do this i got a byte array <end>
get to say 20 new content dot to read something like that to do is what we're going to set our <end>
array and then all we're gonna call it there we <end>
within the parameters and this is yet but i got put a to get our progress <end>
once it returns it's going to look for you know whatever it after i feel about <end>
stuff i believe we're also going to do 20 new content <end>
we're gonna <end>
according to our delete so <end>
to kind <end>
we need to give it to say this bar and then finish our reads kind of our <end>
and a to again this through their <end>
just gonna say <end>
going to say 20 new gl collected array how we do is when this takes a byte array <end>
it's looking for <end>
a comment here so <end>
so now it's looking for now it's given it up here which is equal to the order of <end>
parsing textview so we just need to do is just going to say <end>
going to say <end>
happens if everything is equal to again this is an order of <end>
public <end>
this i was probably it starts going to say 20 new oh and all we're gonna call this textview array so now it's
going to set up what we're gonna say is giving it to do <end>
through array <end>
happens if we go and then we're going to set up a file we're making sure it within our <end>
going to say if they kind of all of saying we're going to say our <end>
exception call it which was called http forward then we're just gonna say if they need to set up a file <end>
going to set up basically going to actually going to set this equal to null so we're going to say - <end>
the type to close and state and we're gonna call this is setup that based properly it's not sure you <end>
string that's fine and so we're going to say dot set uri and you know another string and so after we need to
looking for you're <end>
going to say a great speech dot get information and so what we're going to say hey and we're going to <end>
great onclicklistener so we have a <end>
going to say dot set city and we're going to <end>
then we're gonna set to have to set up our <end>
to kind <end>
line but that's that's being passed in so that's being passed on oh just <end>
which is it to <end>
what's being passed in so we're just gonna say hey we're gonna put a gonna hit dot set to <end>
what's gonna say hey i feel like <end>
textview array passing in our string <end>
send an r <end>
thing that we're gonna call <end>
everything you're like i did the tutorial guys will doesn't bar whoops and go to go to your emulator again you <end>
no <end>
what we're going to add a <end>
layout minus sign land hit start with a default to kind of a <end>
need to do is we also do fos dot i'm sorry after we what we're gonna call one real quick i'm just gonna
set up so there and right here and <end>
prop or go we're just <end>
go up now right here so i'm going to set those up to the xml and go to example and then the code
classes so it's <end>
show you <end>
on those parameters one it what we're going to say this starting <end>
so now what we need to surround this up to the stack <end>
and there we go now what we're gonna do for the most part so that's <end>
get the parameters we're gonna say dot load from data creates we hit <end>
going to call the preferences and now we're gonna say is fos dot open bar to close again our file to to our
we set it up which is the data dot this get data finish that data through this class which is like that we
going to set up <end>
the try brackets a try to context again our try returned and just close we're gonna properly it to close it our file
variable which catches the <end>
let go to our <end>
to do that is the context which will shift f <end>
going to set up to something like that we need to close our data that now with the context it's gonna say the
the reads kind of public would just do is just a ton of a little bit about the method again just say dot
it's gonna give this method is called data so just close the actual <end>
working with a thread which is going to say new execute as and then it externally and then what we need to close
going to say our save button is equal to read about so <end>
get through this time something from the the most part public would just available here to an actual input and it's given it
going to create a class name which is getting our our input let me say public class load data we're just going to
we've named that one and just say get method and say hot or try and catch we get through this is not it
data through this <end>
what we're going to do for <end>
method is just gonna say our open input output exception and just close that reads kind of close exception and what we're <end>
whoa write data we're going to do is the try and catch that's fine and then we're just going to close our file
available so what we're going to say whatever tab data dot what we're going to do public get just hitting the third button
we need to do is that's fine i created which is we're going to go <end>
then the try <end>
what we're also going to give it to close our file name so what we're looking for that we need to do something
let me so a try and catch as well so now the brackets going to <end>
define the <end>
going to have it returns it's going to do is the concept <end>
and the default which is it in a try <end>
what <end>
going to true by the catch as well so if we need you know a catch <end>
stream what we're going to give it <end>
open it a try and catch so now we're going to give it to close again through the <end>
catch our progress bar we need to close it for all right so now what <end>
our input so after that's mainly about so we're going to think about using a try and exception <end>
going to pass <end>
forward slashes and what we're gonna call this is a pretty much about you guys know instead of read through a try and
this textview and what we're gonna write data which i is which is we're going to give it the input <end>
going to say <end>
type it this in a greater than signs <end>
exception so <end>
let me setting the variable that we're going to do now what we're gonna copy this i got some data is less than
close it says sd dot to the parameter which is going to use our open it up which is less than signs <end>
going to say is boolean so we're going to say finally going to say right here so it a input type for the
so now it's given it the exception and <end>
i'm i know <end>
which is a description so it's not sure you know whatever is the progress bar <end>
within a try a try and catch as for the method so what we're gonna do it that's <end>
our try and catch <end>
going to know it's given sure you know whatever is the method and <end>
which is we're going to show up your start it open the default shared java a try <end>
how we're gonna call this is going to say right here is just give us kind of a greater than in the context
just going to create a for the most part now we're going to set up get our output and that's fine because we
we're going to <end>
air some stuff so we're going to say <end>
i'm just gonna take a greater than sign and we know read from our progress bar that's read some stuff that we <end>
this is close our a json object oops <end>
get to a for the command and you know handling all i got a tard via <end>
variable that now we're gonna call this for a ton of a try and close our <end>
as well <end>
so what it returns it's read some stuffed class and again this i kind of <end>
it's given sure a <end>
public and giving us a little time we just close it <end>
give us a while i is pretty much of get data from that we just put exception and again this is a for
that's fine and that's gonna use it within the same brackets read and a try brackets and our load some stuff within here
i setup for his parameters we're gonna call <end>
progress bar position something like another method for <end>
make sense to a for from our <end>
exception array and we've done for the most part so we're that's gonna say we're gonna do it takes a you talk about
need so to give it to put reading all of your textview that we need a ton of <end>
going to do is which is going to refer to our <end>
exception is a trying to do all we're gonna do is how we set up what what we're gonna call this is the
give it was input stream close that means an xml stuff so after <end>
gonna say no no right here and <end>
this right here in this <end>
everything set up a pretty much it <end>
int which is called e dot close and that's going to get the string equal to the default now we copied it a
parameters we're gonna say is make sure which will give it yet which is called our variable name this <end>
in a default sax parser for this is a for the most part it's given it equal to again not read about all
down to get the type one in the <end>
so now what we need to five for the most part it's kind of called get information i believe is you know our
want to give it for that we get kind of <end>
right now we just going to actually needing it i work through here if <end>
it's given it the xml data we're <end>
i'll describe what we're gonna say if we just going to actually going to set up <end>
third the most part after we need to say <end>
going to return a <end>
going to return the <end>
about this our progress bar we actually done this is properly for this <end>
if we've done for the most part this for <end>
that's fine we can just close it <end>
public and that's fine we just need to close it for a string it's gonna call <end>
available so after this instance means it i kind of <end>
in a json object i'm <end>
what did what we're going to read about all of our parentheses it's going to do a little more for all of an
format delete rid of the method that we're gonna say our variable that we need to do first what we're gonna call it
name that we need <end>
available to our <end>
anything we set up at least i kind of what's up a tard via <end>
we could still opened progress bar it's gonna get what what means nothing new input output exception and through which was input stream
to give it with you guys what i was input stuff and <end>
external input and if input and then again to false and milliseconds and that to our input method that so we're gonna set
here and then we're <end>
basically be the most part and there as well but that's at <end>
to false or <end>
just gonna be <end>
tutorial we're just gonna say if equals dot to be that's doing it's pretty much of you know here we also need for
let's just going to parameters we're going to return the string because it's not not too much the type of our surrounding try
available to our <end>
start a few tutorials ago we all these greater than signs <end>
method and it's nice and then add and controller zooms <end>
to get <end>
with get method because we <end>
which again we're gonna say <end>
into ok and not something like map and then and i should be pretty pretty much the whole class but again we can
this compass you we've <end>
hateful times that makes those other one actually i said i know this whole first set up and <end>
new <end>
this geo point the map activity where we just have controller zooms <end>
this geo point and <end>
break here or you know your handle the brackets so that's that's where i mean that's not gonna be the parameters this will
the method basically kind of <end>
and it's only surface for <end>
even <end>
sexy which is fit get fit get fit get fit get fit get fit get fit get fit get fit get fit get
we set the max to which <end>
it to type so you know not too <end>
just gonna call this for our location listener just gonna call this for sure <end>
something like that we set up our address dot get and we're <end>
going to do is we have you know handling all of a handle which we times <end>
like that we set it to short and we can also <end>
this it sorry and we're gonna call this because we kind of clarify selected so we're just gonna call the website so we're
our overlay class which is this <end>
within here it for loop and all we're going to kind of command which is going to get the maximum because <end>
we're gonna get the maximum value so we named that we have a renderer which again you you'd explain everything for the start
gonna type it for the <end>
this geo <end>
gonna be the geo point and we're just gonna call this for this bar i didn't sure a relative layout and i set
which is gonna be it for a for the next tutorial i'll explain it for the power manager so we're getting an error
just equal to you know that a <end>
we're gonna say our surface and there we go <end>
setting that bar is gonna get the <end>
called geo point and our geo <end>
the geo point <end>
it is equal to new for the most <end>
the <end>
equal the columns change it within our <end>
called touched it's <end>
just the touch <end>
this as well and we're gonna display the maximum value so we set equal to new for the entity and that's going to
that sm <end>
the motion <end>
if this greater than <end>
the motion is equal to new bring back like <end>
like that we can set up an <end>
also equal to again the <end>
this set that up to the reference text that we're gonna say <end>
that we <end>
floats for us an int by and we're gonna change it for you know this for <end>
which was that's going to be in our on <end>
equal to this for the maximum of the context that we <end>
asking is the overlay class is we're going to say our on long as well we're gonna set that equal to true because
open stream volume and yeah <end>
call this for a like i mean it's a point and we're gonna say we just gonna call this and again we're gonna
gonna add the motion service and <end>
call this starting we're going to say if we just set up an int that's <end>
going to say as <end>
know it the <end>
gonna be equal to the context again <end>
promise you you see you know that we set up <end>
just gonna be the context again our <end>
or you know the surface as our surface dot on oh and you get rid of that i have a lot <end>
getting passed in the type to something else we don't have the <end>
the <end>
to again it a lot <end>
we're gonna say if it's it for <end>
get like games and resume <end>
false we're just felt for you <end>
that's <end>
it to handle it to actually we can define it yet so kind of give you know our geo <end>
xml here and then and <end>
and it's probably know <end>
but you guys are on pause so it's not i'm gonna kind <end>
want to get into <end>
is getting it takes within the oncreate <end>
if this class yeah we created it looks that's let's see if you and then our handle enough out i kind <end>
this again if i won't you get the bottom i should know a good stuff that's something like 10 class so again this
cool so it's pretty much how to override unimplemented methods add the end of the on alright so we're <end>
little bit messed compass you can <end>
adding two buttons and again <end>
that's pretty quick i don't work you know four out what this starting <end>
