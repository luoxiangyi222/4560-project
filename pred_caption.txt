parameters is we're going to reference our intent that good for the most part so this in our on activity result code one
you know this should be can w equals can or can read can write equals true and lastly and read and write and
well so we're going to say textview nothing <end>
reading so we're going to say result is equal to basically result as well <end>
drawable object or this is going to start up our entry and then we have a bread and it's pointless and this is
again is music and basically <end>
this comes from our on create method gets called simple if you guys can add the on <end>
the id which we called aw has an intent <end>
try and the super here is happy for the most part we're just going to say database version but what we need to
starting point make it an array you know <end>
also going to copy this method called within our if <end>
turn and then down below we're going to say return true and then down below <end>
basically just kind of fine-tuning everything getting you know for the <end>
blow our vertex pointer we're just gonna say gl dot gl color pointer down <end>
or not class or object we're going to call it x i don't know new hot or <end>
for all this application that's good for the xml layout you guys in the next tutorial <end>
we can click that stuff this i kind of add an whole application <end>
toast and display them and then we're just gonna <end>
unzip stuff so i'm just within our application <end>
to do <end>
basket so we're gonna say basket and we're gonna get our <end>
sycamore to our object so zero and then all that's gonna go five things we started underscore stuff so that's pretty simple all
have is set up the again kind <end>
so <end>
is basically start with this in the <end>
a method we're gonna create a new method here is <end>
interrupted air i'm sorry interrupted exception what i was doing that's <end>
actually let's do if changing y is less than a canvas dot get height then <end>
the third one we're going to say parentheses o to d so basically <end>
value that we're reading so <end>
website within our application because that's <end>
actually let's do our canvas dot get width for like <end>
what this on create method i have <end>
let me say public class load some stuff and then what we're going to set up basically going to set up basically going
sure everything works and that's pretty much it is selected now it's not positive yet make sure everything works we're going to do
dot set <end>
set up we don't want <end>
we're gonna set <end>
and set up a bowl something else so we're going to set it up <end>
launched when you know our first class <end>
implemented the configuration type it has parentheses <end>
to our <end>
and <end>
we're going to do is set this equal to 0 now what we're gonna do is do is refer to our <end>
short list so what position we did previously and as well which is to native order again all that up here called our
same key sort and then we need to hit enter we need to hit next and we're going to hit enter and then
to pass in which row we're looking at <end>
like 250 dp for <end>
we're going to perform an <end>
explosion and this is gonna be our imports or sound pool dot and <end>
basics and this code and then you know lesson sign so that's <end>
resume method here that we need to create or a quick it's not going to achieve a hateful <end>
is we did in the onclicklistener type of our shared preferences class just save some time and be button and we're going to
super line right here so i'm just going to delete our <end>
gonna say int max so that's going to do is we're gonna set <end>
sure it works real get y is equal to you know you know you know you know you know you know you know
construct something so this little menu and it and it starts loading a title so we <end>
starting equal to remember <end>
we're gonna set this equal to null and there we go and there we <end>
we're going to say overlay type of list that we also have set <end>
problem real <end>
again it's called sliding drawer it's a variable a toggle button start <end>
for <end>
role i guess after you're like that right here and we're going to say new intent some items within <end>
so what we want basically <end>
don't know how many streams you can have to do it <end>
layout <end>
going to hit finish and if you guys you guys you guys you guys you guys you guys you guys you guys you
delete what we want you know show you that problem real quickly hopefully when we run <end>
extends activity and what extends means is that we're extending the <end>
we're going to say set a comment here for a number and then what we're basically going to just set up a list
we're gonna say this update method minimize that is going to be and we're gonna say this geo point the <end>
something like that then you guys some other activity we're going to refer to our ideas then just so we set this up
we get into the assets <end>
well basically what's happening is we can set up within our on create method <end>
but we have set up basically a geo <end>
pretty like said pretty simple here so let's get rid of code here so what we don't have many <end>
what we're gonna say main dot this and then what we're gonna say main dot this and then we need to probably get
it the activity of short <end>
out just going to work you have so one of method again it's not going <end>
gonna look which we set up our alias or something like that then what you know the city comma state so that's how
this air and catch and duration toast and display it will equal to this is our new boss in so to say toast
we're going to say specs and we're going to say specs and we're going to say specs and then once we want to
we're going to <end>
can just place it within this method that we just created <end>
working with floats and you know everything but we'll get to relate to a <end>
method so you guys should know how to do you guys should know how we're going to go back that's going to hit
for all these other ones as well so not too not too pretty there for that <end>
going to say <end>
but anyways so that's basically gonna be you can see it works you go into our on my bring back to for now
we're going to say <end>
set this up and if the javadoc has anything yeah just kind of reference so we can set up the new boss the
dot get longitude and what we do is say iv for image view object so what language fine-tuning received basically what we did
might not do anything so what i got it for <end>
you notice like our camera our typeface we have in our activity we can do is just hit paste it there and i'm
gonna happen let's just add two that and then we have to do it and we have this to fill the parent as
clicked this cheese variable is going to set up in our song and again we're just going to check out our package name
again it's not it should <end>
completely red and completely green and then no blue and maybe 0.5 for alpha <end>
array and we're just going to just like hey guys welcome to your text view like something like that we're just going to
android gravity to be sinner nothing too new basically that's just type relative layout what we basically go we label this void basically
that <end>
say create dot set next line of the most part we created the content view to return kind of the easy <end>
want to create a view and then what we have to do in this <end>
basically that whole table so think of it for it that way <end>
above our our can set up as well so if we get a false we know <end>
refer to us a little <end>
last tutorial <end>
equals and break here is <end>
what was it an edit text that reference real quick so now what we can do is set up we're going to click
we're just going to use a gl surface view <end>
we just created is regular application this is pretty much the same table <end>
it's just going to find that in mind i created we're going to say at drawable forward slash custom and we called for
the most part boat so think of it just you know this just copy the y value and that's not the plus height
it's just a new class know that we points what we're going to <end>
http variable which <end>
output stream exception and now what we're gonna create a and also we set up a file <end>
going to kind of <end>
say basically set up a string variable so we'll set up a string variable or actually reference and we're just going to access
be kind of we're just going to quickly set the other type or <end>
happens so there and nothing too <end>
gonna set this equal to our song and create <end>
just going to open that so here's our <end>
player dots create context this and resources are dot id dot i mean our <end>
that below and i grabbed one <end>
you can use it so class is button as <end>
reference for tab specs and we're going to do is we a paint in our <end>
which notification we want to notify and all we need to pass in we're thanks for all <end>
make it will be for this is going to do in the next tutorial but just you know <end>
activity here and it's called on options items selected so just look for that <end>
do much but we're just setting it up for the most part again <end>
release other touch event because when we just use a new tab as <end>
now i'm going to say from a password it's travis again travis and again you guys will be to run just talk about
like map activity so now we're going to have a whole chunk of pretty much good to define what we have to import
through here quotations or end or parentheses right here or i'm not i mean i just going to be a text and not
going to just going to copy or cut equals and <end>
connection that we're referring to and then what we're going to leave a comment <end>
give some information you know which will allow our database so what <end>
going to say set up some variables are the sensor <end>
we're just going to say get writable we go we're just have to give it our and we just close that and also
is kind of if everything and these paths <end>
edit text you want so object so we're going to hit new instance of our on create method on create method and then
like what we're going to define what we're going to define it more render so after it should check that link in <end>
constructor is called from the graphics surface class it's gonna you know <end>
this tutorial we don't have a lot of a one and we're gonna pass in that one have you know this geo coder
android project now within this sd card we're gonna call this java or something like for <end>
going to set this equal to like that and then we're gonna <end>
then we'll relate to our gl ten class and then what we're gonna do is we're going to relate to our color or
change this one to like maybe 20 dp see how that looks looks pretty good and <end>
we're going to set that equal to something like 100 because 100 is pretty easy to work <end>
so we're going for the <end>
we get an slash forward slash s android.com forward slash and then this is kind of idea how to <end>
say our <end>
going to work i always debate <end>
going to do is we have to do is basically when we set up some layout this to do <end>
going to be event down here we want <end>
it downloaded because again <end>
so again we've learned about update <end>
this application now set the one called the adt plug-in and then that's happening the activity install the window tab and you guys
you guys how we downloaded because we're going to actually because everything is now all the difficult part <end>
to hit the <end>
gonna say oops at plus ford's f plus id ford / webview browser or something <end>
click that there for the context that <end>
our handle which will take a negative the first for the last second instance of a return method to kind <end>
we're gonna set up i know it's the you onclicklistener so that's we're going to do is we're going to <end>
surface view now what <end>
references available yet we i go over to our xml file save this one as you can see i've done is create called
a let's say set tab <end>
you can see if everything probably all we do is we set up our keyboard so that's going to handle to <end>
basically we're gonna say view and we set up a gl cube renderer that we don't want to make sure all right so
already touch where we sleep method and the <end>
we're going to type it out you through some stuff on this one it's kind of <end>
same as whatever you know our package <end>
eclipse and under this windows tab for for if i mean this override implement methods for a second so basically it's going to
what we do something else we can say stuff here and what we're going to do is basically what we're going to create
in milliseconds here so if i kind of <end>
to go back at zero because as you can go up too so basically we're just going to be disappeared or application it's
shoot it up to this constructor we're basically going to pass in the type overlay so we're all <end>
show you after we type it out and then for the on <end>
we're going to do is we also need to set up a line so we're going to read that pretty much <end>
we're going to say dot <end>
activity again a run method we <end>
reference to specs just kind of define it for the most part right here we're going to say new <end>
i with some more frustum value a little bit better so we're going to be it's never gets called i got to gather
right now i just have <end>
under our media scanner permissions that we're gonna do now is pretty small pretty good stuff for a string called t so what
just kind of understand this type of our set that equal to our whole class for that reference to <end>
array and we're going to <end>
current temperature and fahrenheit is and then space and then we can just <end>
of references of get an edit text so there we go we're going to just like this tutorial or <end>
kind of <end>
here we're going to use our canvas and then we want it takes a typeface so we're gonna say just canvas dot draw
to say key underscore name and then we just say from and quotations again refer to our key name which we're passing in
there's a regular button that we can pull <end>
here called it as a click list as well so kind of just <end>
going to be a little bit of our sensor object that now we don't want the <end>
here for a on <end>
gonna set this and paste this and then or reference stuff so once it so <end>
also going to copy that or set <end>
just going to be like that and add that and the textview name that we're just going to say button we're going to
button i <end>
to zero to start with and semicolon and then we're first <end>
class called simple okay so what the what we're going to do is we're going to do is we're going to do is
just refer to the long class and to edit the person typed into the person typed into the seconds out because again we're
we created is within our list arrays because we set up entries which is what these will be what you guys we're <end>
app with can do <end>
public boolean so we're going to call this <end>
location see where the phone is and all that over in satellite view it's package setup <end>
going to set up set up from <end>
most part <end>
that's not probably the best choice when you guys in the <end>
little bit faster in the z direction as well so again the gl 10 object that so what we're going to say it's
run with because that's just like that we run our now let's run into for the like that we run our address selected
source and you know this goes which on <end>
should know <end>
xml ns ads equals and then we have to put in http colon forward slash <end>
we're going to just hit this so basically paste right now if this tutorial for the new boston again is kind of copy
our typeface we need to give us to <end>
array and then we're going to refer to that and then what we can do is we're going to refer <end>
to do <end>
did it work within <end>
the user of our widget dot a theme dot <end>
data results and we're going to say dot set text again <end>
called shared preferences so we just need to set up a little variable for <end>
worked with a layout and it's always going <end>
then it's looking for again so how we do that so we're just gonna say gl ten i want to get into our
going to go back into our menu class for the most part and i'll show <end>
is gonna do within our save file so now we're gonna within our ellen <end>
bitmap and then we're going to say bitmap based on <end>
we're just gonna call it geo code coder or something like that we're gonna basically again that's what we're gonna do is we're
the bottom or set up we want to say surround this time we also might want to setup a rate we set up
activity for result so we're going to say tab host i know because when we just set up a new <end>
we're going to say view flipper we're going to say view flipper we're going to say view flipper we're going to say view
have standard for us and we're gonna set up to access where you know text now it's still gonna copy and we can
went out order there and then or the context of this <end>
textview that we set up which was called http stuff i believe we're just going <end>
dress like this error so <end>
what we also want and probably look like that we were going to say you guys have no <end>
i'm going to do is we're gonna do is we're gonna do is add a method <end>
so we're gonna call this toggle view will say just copy and set the most part that's <end>
our whole class so we're gonna set it has with this type so we're going to go back that we actually though we
gonna say our whole class we're gonna say hey we're creating a new variable something like that to do is say while true
not do anything so what we're gonna say our surface and then also our our variable arms i'm sorry interrupted exception what we're
to say the <end>
set wallpaper in this <end>
of the last tutorial we're just gonna say prefs right now <end>
says hello world starting point now the <end>
uppercase <end>
back surface copy that <end>
xml it's going to <end>
layout that we also need to be kind of similar <end>
data or boolean or how we got <end>
our data array then within here we set up our input output exception and <end>
on it takes to do is we're going to say contacts get into it in <end>
can say to the same layout so it's going to refer to our url and then just say text or is from our
url something like that we're going to say new xml stuff and let's quickly but it's kind of parsing class put et input
true we want android drawable to equal at drawable and then plus highlight <end>
kind of confusing or the <end>
variable from the media scanner reference name again <end>
we're gonna call this <end>
say so we're going to work we again is that we're <end>
emulator or i just have <end>
everything is <end>
also which whichever id we're gonna say set content view type screen so we registered our listener we have a bitmap set up
confusing because this thread <end>
refer to <end>
for the most part and what we or read <end>
class and we're going to say button check and we need to <end>
click method so we're going to set it up with with an on create we're gonna <end>
within our if this tutorials we're basically going <end>
update our canvas so it's basically got <end>
no most part and hit our background but just click that so into that in the size so we're just going to say
of map activity or actual <end>
to switch and all that we set up our that's going to say we <end>
dot set our max volume and then we're gonna say current v and that's what you're like that and again we can't i'm
is where we're just going to do is we're going to do is we're gonna work to work with our first so if
obviously this didn't really <end>
something a little bit new that you guys need to realize when you make one <end>
as this it hits the motion <end>
paint dot and then what does and then we'll do so what what we don't want to our typeface so what that's equal
gonna say address address dot get position zero or location zero and <end>
within our on resume method well but let's open up after our file <end>
manifest so that's what you're within the manifest again that's where <end>
be accessible to the surface view like this holder and then context we want it get into it yeah we're gonna say and
like to that we're gonna say set on <end>
guys kind of understand just like always we do with with the <end>
tutorial i again mean it's going to add our input method that would be our text so again is just the textview was
we start it <end>
finish this parameter we're going to say results underscore okay all cap locks and that's kind <end>
basically got to implement that kind of how you guys but just kind of set up variables so we're just going to <end>
automatically for you but <end>
set onclicklistener to this tutorials says <end>
within there we <end>
and then again we can set up some defaults that i don't have a tri bracket that's going to set this integer array
like our <end>
there we go with <end>
we're going to say show you guys an error right of our tab to this so we're going <end>
it yet i'm just going to flip through it also gonna say option three <end>
going to be <end>
going to call it just going to copy and we're just going to be like that let's just get the onclicklistener again this
going to say spinner equals again spinner and find view by id rg <end>
we're going to go we can set up summary this is what we're going to go we need to say android /list and
click starting point right <end>
passed in the <end>
set <end>
sorry this is our application is we're going to change because everything works here so we're going to move it up our references
everything else so we're going to say android id equals 100 and then at another reference because you guys but anyways and then
hover over a class but i don't know scroll down to the view which is setup <end>
it within our sql view that's going to refer to a checkbox checkbox preference and we're going to say true and then we're
errors in <end>
gl lower case like that sorry and then we're just gonna say gl gl gl gl gl gl gl dot gl color pointer
thing we need to do is now i probably won't work with what this or do is we're going to say main class
initially so x is our surface view <end>
class so we're gonna say this which is getting <end>
we're doing now is looking for now we're going to call it the period to do is we're gonna do is we're gonna
obviously since this is an int because we haven't done with how we're reading the first thing <end>
of class by saying want so we're just going to <end>
know add button i'm going <end>
is basically that's basically be our that's basically be is basically b for green ball so let's go back and then actually let's
before this before on resume method so we're going to say contacts dot power service now that's basically just getting <end>
we're going to say return so <end>
and we're going to do is we can write to add a permission to our manifest so we can write to <end>
hopefully we'll give yourself it but if we set up basically basically that's the string buffer and what we're going to add our
our buffer and this is say skip out <end>
part we're also going to set that equal to within parenthesis textview and find view by <end>
something like that so we're just going to say static final static final static final static final static final static final static final
you guys noticed that we need to set up a just like we need to set up like that we're going to add
be set clickable so we're going to set that we're going to set up some of these methods that calls the on click
i'm just gonna set this equal to and then what we're going to leave a comment <end>
for a layout tab for the most part nothing defined it what you know if i guess i guess we <end>
can also what you know check it out so wrap the text our text our button be what we're going to go back
fill parent i'm <end>
variables to be int so we're going to do is just maybe and now what we're going to be int so we're going
gonna say <end>
blue and <end>
true we want android drawable to equal at drawable and then plus highlight <end>
surface we can say surface surface view class so we <end>
work is equal to false and then we're passing in the context this is basically like that or try and then we're going
we're going to say return you know or json dot get string and <end>
string so we're going to <end>
going to go into our external data and we're just going to save <end>
center it as well so we're just going to go to be wrap content again it's basically our button and then check that
right we're going to go over it again it's going to hit this whole activity so just to actually and then hit this
parameters is we're going to reference our variable that we set up email intent <end>
whatever whatever you guys <end>
all this to scroll view will say android weight sum equals 100 we have our scroll <end>
but anyways so that's basically the <end>
then we also might take <end>
just set the http example and now nothing new android <end>
most part so we're going to say switch and within our random <end>
hear and again we're gonna set up a method here out of the sort so if our seat bar <end>
where we're going to set the alpha we created called slider items is pretty simple basically you guys going <end>
to say catch like an exception ii and then we're <end>
get in there and put our whole screen and you know get to start it by just one here because again i know
refer to <end>
string then we're going to say string f i don't know and basically we just going to save what are <end>
gonna add our byte buffer call <end>
create an error <end>
normally would launch and hit ok or start and there we go our <end>
within our graphics our layout so we need to define what we need to use this create from the mac <end>
within parentheses and <end>
we're gonna say we have to do is <end>
xml file <end>
and we're going to have within here we're <end>
start with so when they do the click which goes through this on click method and it is we do that is pressed
widget config and that's gonna basically widget config and that's gonna basically widget config and that's gonna basically widget config and that's gonna
again just like that so specs is our tab specs is we're going to say our variables which comes from the tab host
the method <end>
listeners - both are save and/or <end>
do is it's going to change <end>
gl object all again we're just gonna <end>
working with some sort and <end>
give this a <end>
view within <end>
so again we decide are i decided been saved and it's not sure we kind of our get data and we're just going
1 is can be it to have on create method and we're going to say we're going to say we can do is
of our oncreate method <end>
just added reference your first name or if <end>
which is our edit text <end>
new boston and i'm just going to say key store hit enter and then we have to hit enter and then we can
klaus so we can easily just hover over the air and say surround with try <end>
then just right here all upcase and then all we need to do is create <end>
again this is set up this works and click on the actual xml and then just save everything works here is we <end>
get and that's it again the text again type <end>
to set up through this button it's going to deliver some data <end>
name is equal to the stuff let's check it gives us to <end>
then we also have to add our state as well some lines here that we can do is a string it's not too
going to go over through all that good stuff so we're going to say option here and then set up an edit text
going to say save it was sliding view by id again all we want to call the edit text find view by id
defined this bitmap we're also going to say d which is but i call it there's a shortcut there and nothing too <end>
um and what we called our song oops <end>
add <end>
ten dot right then <end>
data so we're going to say <end>
maybe for us and then we just have <end>
graphical view we're going to go over to change <end>
button i created now menu for the most part so here's our layout here - to do <end>
have to call this ad is also set webview as a switch over can you know get street view are we have to
our on oh what we're gonna say within focus they're going <end>
to like that we can copy that way to work now what we're just gonna copy the action name is going to there's
some sort and <end>
so we're going to say results underscore okay all cap locks and that's <end>
client state and <end>
well walk you through manifest again right here for <end>
define this to implement <end>
might not always yep of options whoa so what alright well hopefully you guys kind of understand this high it's it's not sure
minimum time we'll give it like half a second and for listener we're going to scroll down to the context it's called display
have to set buttons text so we're gonna say this onclicklistener so we're gonna say if <end>
can just place it within this time we can say you guys can implement methods font <end>
pretty simple and to set up an first activity class so we're going to say touchy we're going to say touchy we're going
and we're going to set compass equal to new <end>
to actually use this we're gonna create a new string that we set up within this line but we aren't going to give
there we go youtube within our ad is we're gonna call this ad is say keyboard what id is going to load when
try and go through go somewhat slow through this throw through this <end>
well i'm just set up this then the geo point we're going to <end>
get and as you can add our title and and what we're gonna say place a textview set button go figure right then
called time and it's going to change it run our <end>
do something new every time as you can see <end>
well because you know those are in our internal stuff that we have <end>
relate to our <end>
we're going to say get system than do anything with it green ball right now nothing new here again that's the package my
start watch and change <end>
which is our drawable and also the context of our main class so we're <end>
string and then we're going to say our edit text and then we can say is going to send a <end>
with this new class we also have to that we want to do is <end>
dot and then we'll probably <end>
to do is we actually <end>
just type because i just wanted to get into it it's a class we're just going to say save i'm gonna again this
just say on create methods <end>
then we <end>
checkbox and we're going to say <end>
little you know a little <end>
been found for the most <end>
android <end>
going to get you though we need to comment out make sure you guys remember exactly same so what we need to say
can do <end>
key was or q is our base url and lastly we set up a default value i mean that's you can set up
use i didn't really explain but that's gonna be like our main context or <end>
watching i'll just get some resources to follow it so it can actually going to google maps and <end>
we're going to create string <end>
we're gonna set up the next boss and we're going to say set content is another class we're going to say remove preference
all that good stuff so there we go and then we're gonna allow our oncreate method so it's <end>
that symbol <end>
source override implement methods and this we're just going to do again we're just going to do again we're doing all <end>
follow along along for the next tutorial and there and nothing new there and what we're setting it down here for us and
do is we need to give it our thread is called so we're going to say we're done and <end>
to do it won't do <end>
dot get x you can get kind of a quick true so <end>
most part we're going to <end>
and now that's where we can do is we have to be on our application because that's pretty much stuff on my hard
right here it's going to go we look like that then you guys some time get android id and then i'm gonna pretend
enable and we're just gonna refer to the gl ten class dot gl underscore col <end>
reference but you know also <end>
don't probably need to go on that on <end>
something like that third else if it was so it has been set up within here <end>
makes some sort of a you know what's happening is set up an xml reader as well that's <end>
to make sure it works now i don't worry about that code but it's <end>
event and we're going to call that e and a map view which we're going to <end>
the video but i want to give it our widget which we touch listener or context because again it's basically paste it within
music now so we can read and once this is going to do is just created again this is for we're creating path
just gonna be void table <end>
neat pretty cool all that good stuff but that's for the methods that in the views i'm sorry space and this is a
kota for and what we're gonna do is we're gonna say random and we have that class so we can set equal to
array and we're going to say like something like that that's something like that that's something like that and the next tutorial let's
date button what we're going to go to <end>
int longy it's also a drawable so <end>
call it start so we're going to say start is equal to and then we're <end>
package name and it's called menu class we're going <end>
before we set <end>
as well so gl gl disabled and again the gl 10 class dot gl the buffer so but why <end>
string and we're gonna set this equal to whatever so this is a message <end>
parameters the text which is called data string we're going to pass in there we go basically basically which is our integer which
what we're gonna be able to fix for us and as you can see we implemented like our <end>
referring to <end>
returning false so just change that they're going to open it with this right <end>
going to do the on click this check man toggle button was a <end>
sensor event listener and that's gonna be basically our sensor of <end>
pause and there it yeah it's going there because it's fully <end>
dress like this so we're just gonna call it so what we're gonna do is we're gonna say set it up now we
variable pass hog which is our toggle button so pass tog and to say set onclicklistener <end>
going to <end>
right here and as well and we get into just go <end>
reference it to that our map overlays right so now what which is equal to our met our main overlay list that we
we're going to say this client is going to delete the basic here <end>
know it's like you're a alpha we need to <end>
and this <end>
what we're going to do is we're going to <end>
forward slash details question mark id equals and then greater than sign <end>
if expression mark or exclamation mark can't i'm sorry x exclamation <end>
that symbol <end>
like next tutorial <end>
call this err we're gonna set this equal to e dot to string and then we can set up within here and then
going to call this open up for this tutorial so i just wanted to talk through this open up for if you click
we can run our json object so we're going to surround this class here we have a method on progress dialog something like
trouble with so would <end>
a new database or not you know <end>
call <end>
we're going to say xml file output exception <end>
statement and we're going to set up <end>
database and what we're going to paste this <end>
function within our map so we're just going to should but that's for the sdk has a good again for <end>
right here it's a reference type of a linear layout it's a scroll view <end>
point so we're gonna say touch point and then we're also gonna add some you <end>
gonna copy the canvas just like that context it's gonna set up our bitmap set up some more variables <end>
arraylist and we have a while <end>
going to call this returned picture because once sorry our camera <end>
pretty pointless you and you can just be it <end>
more and there we go we want to <end>
we're just going to work with it around and all that stuff that's about the size that's going to go over into the
so we do <end>
for the most part set content view in our bundle nothing new my throat's kind of default intent and again is going to
but uh here's our square and what we're going to be clockwise again we want to create on the only have on the
up now <end>
graphical layout and then we're going to change this one it's a one by right-clicking with and i'm going <end>
data is an email and just want to kind of an error because everything works i'm also going to hit ok <end>
quickly again i had the emulator <end>
context it's it's not going <end>
set it below and then a colon and then a colon so i'm <end>
tweet we're going to say zero here tweet we're going to say zero here tweet we're going to pass in the most recent
in the tutorial section <end>
parentheses we refer to our <end>
say <end>
but it's yeah trap travis music test as well and then the sd or this cable plugged in the sd or this cable
instead of saying set content view we're basically going to setup our <end>
to say our tab and then we just say set content view <end>
variables once they're doing in quotations again being passed in now let me just set up which is <end>
format it as you can see then we're just going to change the most part <end>
too blue and all we hit back to the application <end>
through everything we have <end>
have on this get this project or the application <end>
variables up with with an on create method as well and kind of a second <end>
hit finish as and that's going to determine which there's <end>
going to be event down here that's good stuff yeah background and both of our geo coder and what we're going to <end>
have our font and <end>
variables to print and we're just going to say if location is not null then when it has changed you know this location
for the most part now what stuff and what we're gonna do is we need to add a file put a sleep within
tab after you're done with kind of a capital u and another method that one of this method and then another example of
go in our <end>
or whatever you know have that reference <end>
above your ondraw method there we <end>
can r and then the last state we're gonna say hey i don't know <end>
gonna happen so now that we extended the or you guys what's gonna happen so we're gonna do so <end>
now what <end>
going to do is we can set this equal to <end>
of the y-direction quotations we're going to set this equal to <end>
variable from the within there and then within <end>
because again it's context which we set the <end>
database so we're just going to again set it insert endpoint or on <end>
we're just gonna say android value that's what we have is set <end>
our font and what we can refer to the name string so what we can say changing y is less over in so
as well so gl gl disabled and again the gl 10 class dot gl the buffer so after we you <end>
and we've learned than the four paths which i don't even working so hopefully you guys kind of understand that it's from the
hotness i don't know have is we're going to say database version and we're going to say <end>
and paste it to that's going to want <end>
class and all right so what we're gonna do is now i have to add one we're going to go back to that
we're going to copy that and paste that we <end>
tutorial guys the <end>
what we want the other thing that spoke correctly and we're gonna <end>
where we're going to basically be obviously but this is from the tab host <end>
again r dot travis gl enable <end>
guys caught on our data hit stop just set up in the next tutorial getting the next few tutorials but just paste <end>
what we're going to do is we can say instead <end>
again with my bring <end>
we're gonna set it so we're going to set it equal to 0 the <end>
view which we call show result and we're going to say dot we're show results <end>
we're gonna set up the last tutorial is basically pretty much good widget that so it's like that you import that and the
within the same options here and then what we want to lay <end>
that is we want to be like that we're gonna <end>
can say <end>
and we're gonna call this one we're gonna call this save file two buttons confirm and again we <end>
gonna call the context of this class and <end>
constructor again when we <end>
application working and we'll need to <end>
let's <end>
to open so we're gonna open or the pending intent we're going to set this equal to the pending intent variable is going
going to refer to the reference so what we're going to do is basically our <end>
our you know our sensor x is equal to our changing y is equal to our our ball is drawn so <end>
it within our if we have to within our on within this on pause method you know we should override implement two within
need to do is gl object or gl 10 object so what we're gonna refer to our viewport and we actually see added
extra results basically this opposed to or whatever <end>
going to set our gravity within our on create bracket and then edit text commands within <end>
set up entries which is we're going to refer to the value so that's what it's a list to <end>
to get to it but i put in quotations and you know <end>
surface now let's kind of are basically with it is which is going to do is <end>
- and signs and then we created our background or it for so within <end>
to clear new programmers example we're just going to say so gl ten we're going to do is we're going to do is
here's our within the most part so we have the most part so the android that we set up the android layout it's
just kind <end>
and then we just going to be public void set city and then <end>
you can just add that one in your you know kind of desired results in the things that <end>
android dot a p-- widget dot action dot an all uppercase app widget <end>
method i'm going to say name because it's going to be 1 2 3 4 etc we should be it get writable <end>
android dot a p-- widget dot action dot an all uppercase app widget <end>
basically the android manifest and we got our emulator goes into our emulator goes into our emulator goes into our emulator goes into
resource folder but that's equal to this <end>
going to say sup a new string variable call it <end>
and state and we're gonna call <end>
alias maps key store hit enter and then we need to create a password that <end>
gonna go into the graphics surface class by now and we're gonna go too surface <end>
going to add the home screen and we're gonna say extends activity and we're just going to say extends activity and if <end>
basically this on draw is going to be looping so we can say changing <end>
and we're also just renaming the select <end>
prompt on mac you guys want to go to your terminal which i believe is <end>
the context what we're gonna say <end>
so there we go and then we need to say yeah then what we're gonna set this equal to again the sort so
and there we go now we can set <end>
you can still pan you guys might like i use it might not maybe that <end>
doing that's just kind of understand that you guys kind of understand that you guys kind of understand that you guys kind of
scroll all the location <end>
edit text within a code so we <end>
we're gonna set this int explosion x and resources are dot id dot get <end>
to set the gravity to left so again it's just gravity dot left and then we <end>
going with <end>
gonna say dialogue call it x 1 and then we're going to set <end>
thing and we created a static string from here again to actually reference that we need to set up a static file name
android and then android xml file <end>
i shoot down here so what we're going to scroll through everything that's pretty good <end>
get the new programmers this <end>
don't worry called a reference a <end>
down to again <end>
input type that we created again it's just within our if <end>
right so to pull this up <end>
and over until you know it's read through <end>
all we're going to say a float row four methods so that's just going to do is we're going to say disabled and
get the package name <end>
can type that we just want to go i set <end>
canvas i should say <end>
unclick for the sub and paste it within his parameters we're just going to subtract by one all right something like that also
it's pretty standard you use the method <end>
gun which won't really but again so let's check that <end>
going to copy and we're going to do is we can set up within here now we created basically you know add to
refer to the configure is a problem real <end>
have some stuff that we just created above our our textview again we're just going to copy that <end>
dot set latest event info recruit into context we're gonna say body and lastly our pending intent <end>
switching case in our email activity because it gives us some of program let's start up an <end>
set up a textview <end>
that's going to be set text and we're going to say start dot set text and we're going to say <end>
maps and we're going to call this google maps <end>
scroll down <end>
this on click all we're going to do is we're going to do is we're gonna do is we're gonna do is we're
activity so <end>
getting and now what we're gonna do is we're gonna <end>
how to <end>
simple pretty easy stuff we want to <end>
now our application <end>
file that in that splash and we're gonna do is we're doing for the most <end>
going to do by <end>
30 minutes we're going to also set this it's going to cut that <end>
you look <end>
so we're gonna <end>
so <end>
our wakelock internet and we've already be on that and then add another one for our <end>
to clean out we're going to have true and valid just define <end>
to start over but our last activity that all we're actually gonna be <end>
equal to which is question we're going to say dot set text and then we're <end>
say dot set the title and whatever our dialogue i'm just gonna do is <end>
edit text within that error <end>
going to say final static string and we're just going to say final static string and then we just created e^x we're going
into our widget itself that loop from <end>
we're just gonna say p index dot length times that by two for two bytes <end>
what this stuff so that's what what static means that we need to do is we're going to refer to this time and
the next <end>
our array list so we're going to set this equal to entity utilities dot to <end>
can or we're going to say switch and hit a new cases because if statement and also we're going to say switch and
ball so that's our input stream and we <end>
array dot and set up our edit text <end>
different ids of this splash to be a file <end>
can see the <end>
folder now what this by ford drops android background as you can see <end>
mess around with and we're going to say add <end>
gonna say about it has all the ones i can you know on create method called hot or not going to run so
create an overlay and we're gonna change <end>
string called in our in the next few different take it as you guys put things within our actual density in last example
everything that's good for <end>
these and go back to get back and type that get into just going to add that up here just going to do
little bit of <end>
we're gonna say input stream and we're going to say we can use it to null we're going to say bitmap actually let's
there and then we're gonna copy that prints the y is our final x here hopefully this tutorials not but i mean it's
you can see it has this i mean this is our flags and again you can see it has to do is we
gonna say try here and then what we're going to do is we're going to do is we are going to do is
widget config and that's gonna say 300 or 320 by 100 and this is dp or actually a problem because i want you
created and forth <end>
super line right here so i'm sorry for this tutorial or cube are gonna do is we can do is go now within
so we're gonna <end>
referring to it array that we actually want to follow this up in our <end>
excuse me i just to do for the most part so you do we click that does is valid to comment under our
the first thing just like that as well and also we <end>
we're going to say get <end>
identifier for the most part now i'm gonna get <end>
relate to that and then what we're gonna refer to this that's what we're the <end>
recognition information the <end>
we're gonna right click on our package name that <end>
and then what we're gonna public not going to run our application on it confusing right now every time for the new boss
item <end>
going to do is make this we're working with and we have to import it a private <end>
textview a textview we're going to change the label the name just be sinner nothing too new basically that's going to say t
to say use this button is dot set gravity and we can say dot dot set the text size so we can say
our content view to was it r dot layout <end>
well all right the same kind of delete that <end>
then set up an slash summary you're spelling is this or something like <end>
gonna say language is if the device has voice recognition activity is this class so <end>
title or status bar so that's we're gonna import that where we have <end>
that's going to be kind of how you do is basically what happens now is basically how we do is set up just
know create the <end>
going to <end>
going to give it also going to refer to the manager to <end>
to do like i said i said that toggle button here <end>
little method called extends our thread for the most part so i really updating it to do is we want to do is
stream dot sleep and does is we need to kind of understand that execute again it's gonna read <end>
name like <end>
something <end>
everything set it right here so basically <end>
it's going to go shared preferences class so there and so what i set up the variable is going to go crazy for
nothing too simple browser we have to return true or false so we have to get the motion event dot disable compass returning
location overlay and we're just gonna relate to our touch method so let's check out to do is you know this is <end>
want and nothing <end>
with this right here and this <end>
well i'm just copy that we do is we're gonna say <end>
and button start watch and a stopwatch and button start watch and a stopwatch and button start watch and a <end>
basically what's gonna happen is it's gonna shoot over to our hot-or-not class <end>
to look at it has a default what we're going to set this equal to entity utilities dot to get another default for
dot set text get string and we're also the value that again this is kind of <end>
dot set step onclicklistener we're going to be like that is we're going to use just kind of <end>
listener because again all that as you know it's an file this tutorial i just go <end>
save this crazy or not going to do is set display and we're going to create add to the right for case three
we're gonna say new has been set up a new http example and quotations again whatever is kind of a loading data we're
say one relative or this kind of <end>
can do now have in with this on value which will start to pass down here in with <end>
class and paste that we're also gonna create a new class gets variable name and then we're also gonna create a new class
do in that configuration class back to the left it goes to equal to the right of the the right there is we're
android sdk avd manager we're <end>
is going to be a string called url and this r we're we're going to say is we're going to say again a
things with this try and catch that's <end>
access them for <end>
through this is going to be and again <end>
unregister it so we also want to set it equal to kind of see <end>
gonna create the variable we're gonna create a 3d <end>
on it takes around this so just you know it's basically going to get something <end>
have there we go we're kind of things we're going to say v the random set up a case so we're going to
class so we're gonna say info dot set city <end>
and it <end>
to implemented it it's comm or renderer and what i text then just set up a new for now if we go into
so we want to do is basically going to leave a little method basically all we need to happen so we're going to
floats for float variable variables sx for starting x point sy for starting <end>
back to our image view right here and it has have a tree or <end>
we're going to say just going to define the on click method so we can do that we're going to say i within
wrap content too as well so we're just gonna say android <end>
going <end>
to say a row then whatever is being passed in which we just want to paste that edit text because this last row
i don't know like we need to do is <end>
buff and there we go now we can't have a short and we're just gonna say gl gl just for the most part
divide it by one e have set up divide it for divide it by one e <end>
again just hover over to the id so we're going to do is we're gonna set <end>
again we just again i know if we <end>
we're going to define you guys then and hope you have a pretty familiar with this text or getting kind of good stuff
up but you know because i told you <end>
set up our progress method to do is we're going to set this equal to again above our on progress gets passed in
set up a dialogue and we're going to say textview tv equals new instance of that get information <end>
what we're going to do is basically again we can type so we need to set up our our textview which is the
sorry for now so we're going to say <end>
it's you guys want to we're going to go over the <end>
file and then you'll kind <end>
and there we go in this tutorial because it's going to run it and now <end>
and if we are going to give us the pretty much the <end>
has been created for your action equals new string and all right here we <end>
maybe like plus our sensor y <end>
also our <end>
going to set this equal to textview variable called <end>
all we're gonna say is our surface view i created off the size of our surface view i created that way i kind
to show you the methods but hopefully it up to it for the methods that we run our application on it <end>
going to say set up and nothing there and nothing <end>
just kind of start a thread now because we've defined so we're gonna say our thread and then dot start and that's pretty
about and <end>
kind of <end>
save your highlighted or whatever you just reference check box you guys might want to do it within our sql view we're going
little comment here that says full screen and then you guys aren't trying to this will again trust me as <end>
we're going to have within here so that's what we've simple we're <end>
going to pass in the <end>
to be nine that's pretty good and then we're going to set gini <end>
and then we're gonna call <end>
int or <end>
that's gonna be protected because again we're implementing <end>
let's get any airs you <end>
right-click you know right click in that free space go to android project <end>
crit and enabled only to false and as you can see use the bottom and paste <end>
make sure our edit text file input stream and go we can just kind of understand that i'm sorry it's going to call
going to say set equal to the class has the most part so what we're gonna say dot get projections or get projection
constructor also and for and let's do but just basically that's basically all right so hopefully that but that we can set <end>
before but just to make our application right <end>
but what we're just gonna happen down a couple more than just elaborate a little bit better overview we've set up which i
can just kind of delete it out of <end>
know set up some <end>
oncreate method right here in <end>
service and what service do we want to get well we want to get well we want to get well we want to
whoops cursor dot get string and then <end>
so we're just going to move this try <end>
can see it takes a group or this so there we go through here basically what we're going to say about <end>
this out and each list item here so basically it our menu class what's up guys welcome to that string array we don't
variables so the first row here we're going to switch over here i working with this means that's happening we need to do
to just say one as plus id forward slash and it's going to set this to also say android use this is a
for application now what i'm just going to work you can see what you click that you click that good stuff but all
dot google dot ads so i want the id for slash and then run our manifest and then i'm just going to put
button right and if it's going to do is we're going to kind of a <end>
data so we're going to say <end>
something called cool and <end>
surface class so now what we're gonna do is what we're gonna do is again it's gonna call this import our class here
volume and we're going to <end>
equals true we can get the <end>
whatever let me pull this over can you go into finder documents android <end>
space and then again just cursor dot get string and then as <end>
imports and you know also for again we can get we want to reference in the point two you know we want to
give us to look like but there <end>
and we're just gonna say dot will set up a string so there we go let's just scroll name and we're just gonna
the video but i'll explain <end>
clockwise as well so we're gonna go six five four all right and we're pretty <end>
and we can add some stuff this takes some variables we want to do is we're going to surround this <end>
simple to be which is basically set up a context so that's gonna call this constructor custom pinpoint <end>
we're gonna set this up the context it's going to <end>
check it make sure i don't know <end>
files pretty simple i mean this is work with the default or set that stuff i don't know xml this is going to
release now what we need to still well we're going to say new one send and also set up can see over here
title list set up a key reference we're going <end>
here we're gonna say key row id comma key name which will be eye data is our database and a value to null
get <end>
have <end>
accelerometer so let's you know go now and it's gonna create it accelerometer so let's you know go into activity import that and
pretty simple and these touch screen <end>
gonna be a new again and what we're going to reference a kind of kind of got <end>
we can make it work and we're going to say our result divided by 60 wait no divided by <end>
won't be asked so let's just check it our menu now as you can see the next tutorial probably show you guys that
that's what we're going to go with let's just kind of set up for sql view class we do is just with the
have our surface the android and this will kind of gut it out for the most part we want <end>
paste it and we have <end>
thing that a little bit better overview of that we go <end>
entity and there we go we've set up our bufferedreader and again we just <end>
a right here we want <end>
going to run and go for this tutorial is we import the surface right and we're gonna say extends activity and then just
going to be set our cursor so what we're gonna do is we're gonna say <end>
off the most part what that's going to go that's decent name it's pretty good that it's going to go that's decent name
and within <end>
by right-clicking within the brackets going down to the source and then <end>
to this our final y which happens every time we have our final y and this line is that <end>
render it animates to <end>
to create a class within that <end>
also call that list as well we're gonna you know it's actually we're actually told you scroll up our list arrays and all
and our key tool - list space - <end>
good review here async task and then we want a string reference anta juror <end>
i think that's besides setting our array xml file we're going to call this array because again it's <end>
result as <end>
you know this activity again just set up the other thing we just need to do is <end>
just for <end>
we're going to say shared preferences and we're going to <end>
class is equal to or attributes that's being passed on orders and copy that and <end>
for click that and those things that <end>
array and we're going to say <end>
guys can you guys don't know that's where it's the same sure they sweet <end>
android layout height is going to be what we're going to change all set button to do like i know that's what that's
we're going to say we say this so one as <end>
travis loves bacon but it's just going to do <end>
this again kind of look they have the setting it up a <end>
uses permission again we want you through that but yes set wallpaper <end>
you know our state where we can read and write and can w equals false here <end>
same sql lite open helper and then always reference and one last class so we're just gonna get everything error because you again
nebraska or whatever the person searched for so we're gonna have say kind of these things within the same again for for the
gonna be <end>
and we're going <end>
content view above our our starting point and the view class so we're gonna give us manage <end>
we're gonna say create method <end>
for the most part again we can set the comment <end>
we're doing in the right <end>
gonna reference then our lurtz gonna show up it's basically just you know <end>
saying hiding the xml stuff so what you can create a little bit further you have of our our handle which we called
dot start <end>
backpack and there we go with the intent we want to open and there we go we want <end>
is if you click that and just add two classes and <end>
random object called our set this equal the new random and then we're all <end>
comment or project for you know email and then under this way to <end>
gonna say find you guys an air so i kind of an error <end>
and so if this is not not found so it's draw <end>
see it's going to be good for <end>
to be a comm google and then we're going to still gonna be clips right and i'm going to create a new java
going to have <end>
and what we're just going to say display is <end>
tutorial will allow it upgraded apk is actually reference that we want to move it to rotate and then basically the value of
the variable that data and this is basically going to say is data is equal <end>
that's what we're gonna say dot update method what we're gonna say dot <end>
saying hiding the keyboard after using an edit text so again if you're <end>
we're going to say a new <end>
or not we're gonna do is learn a <end>
refer to again gl ten we're just gonna say dot glu glu look at <end>
gonna happen let's check it there we <end>
next maybe this on click method to right-click because the <end>
see alright so we're going to work so that's being locked <end>
to say item is it to set these methods that we can kind of the one again trust me where we're going to
change you know when we implement the sensor event listener passing the only case we have everything works here while i mean it's
going to say we're going to say set up our add view and then within our on create method and we're going to
go in this direction so seven six four something like that and then <end>
going to be it to use the bottom and again we just have to do is we're going to use a um so
it for the text is going to pass which is if the the same has to refer that is if this up that
documents folder for the actual object that's going to import that we're going to import both those guidelines properly but that's pretty going
guys created that list <end>
it displays a method that and <end>
within our on create hit <end>
returning let's just do is we're gonna kill now so what we're gonna you know the <end>
in street view so we want to work that's what our on drawer class so now what we want <end>
line and it in the right here so i'm going to set up a quick it'll get that button pretty easy so you
dot to the media player class so we're gonna continue again we just need to call this our song and how would be
let's run which is going to say our de name of the <end>
for the most part doesn't have you know android background image <end>
is a view so we're gonna say bound the context that's being passed in again the system service and then give the context
our variable from a new variable for a switching case then we're going to call this check string variable a string first something
what we're going to change the label the button results so we're going to change the label the button results so we're going
webview and we're going to say our dot we're going to say dot load url and then we're just going to toggle to
in milliseconds here so how that's probably event happens so this is we're gonna say <end>
we need to hit paste in <end>
here for your database and for <end>
gonna say new input source and we're gonna refer to our website or url <end>
going to set this up for where we're going to say android id equals and then android padding and then android padding with
role i guess it's not again but we're just <end>
say we're gonna set this to be wrap content view and <end>
gonna toggle between <end>
right now we're going to <end>
public and we're gonna say hot or not and it's gonna take in a context i <end>
we're going to say this equal to work with so what we're going to refer to that we're gonna first what we're going
you know just search activity here and you're a on <end>
we're going to say for results just seeing if there's some other ones <end>
again i told you guys try and then we want this class here so what we want this but since i'm going to
gonna be true or <end>
text view gotta import text even though we're in state x dot set text to <end>
so we can say like <end>
is by one is we can say on click <end>
going to be apostrophe er but we're going to update <end>
gonna say new hot or not and again <end>
string so we're going to say string f i don't know and we're gonna get our <end>
so we're just gonna within <end>
to say negative 1 / top value we're going to say just for example 0.5 <end>
we're <end>
our context that we're going to give it something with those parameters again <end>
going to do actually relates to the last tutorial so you may <end>
so we're going to give it <end>
messed up on some of these i don't know if i am or not i'm think <end>
in the one last one <end>
so like i said widget so it's going to <end>
which i've already called <end>
just closed off our statement with a forward slash a lesson sign so <end>
this default what the string that we <end>
because again you might like that new get and then we're going to call this our url lowercase dot - <end>
database helper and then what we're going to say our helper and we need to be basically what we're <end>
sit onclicklistener real quick again this class is going to implement <end>
whatever start time get you know whether you're like item and forgot already called save file dot get <end>
going to help you guys again to set up our set up another text view you then we're going to say got basket
test so i'm going to set that up real quickly <end>
of what we <end>
and the <end>
we're going to copy all over here to kind of have this should be true and lastly can w <end>
we go to our android manifest and for a little bit of <end>
just going to set <end>
sexier and that's for text activity for the most part so how you because i want you guys <end>
do is you're just going to do is the first thing we want quickly edit <end>
gonna say new type of the shared preferences and then all we're gonna do is we're gonna refer to our website or url
references so we won't have to remember exactly every line of code that <end>
our starting our starting our starting our thread our our thread is not or if they scroll down and so we're <end>
within the sort so what we're gonna go it's not program it's kind of do is we're gonna kind of do this class
latitude and for my longitude i'm just gonna again type in some numbers let <end>
just hit comma do is how to code is going to you guys to do is hit hover over and say import <end>
constructor also here and then basically we're going to use the constructor we're going to change this <end>
it's really not too bad and now the current time and we're going to again the <end>
we modified at the second what's up guys give it a geo point <end>
basically we're going to go over through that reference is like okay delete this this is regular application it's going to be a
completely red and completely green and then no blue and maybe 0.5 for alpha <end>
it's going to say <end>
our buttons when we hit our buttons make sure really too <end>
is going to be vertical i had <end>
and <end>
permission uses permissions and then our project and over that now i likely this later and it's going <end>
the most part boat so think of it just you know this these new you know our displacement for the x value that
that is going to be the app app widget layout again it's just going to be like <end>
within our manifest and <end>
create a <end>
so that's s again nothing new and then in quotations we're gonna add our state as well some some stuff within our our
going to go above our or something you know xml it's being focused on we're going to give us where you guys how
up to read the item one we're going <end>
config and we're gonna have our edit text also just be et widget <end>
guys kind of understand <end>
need to add our view and add our composite this tutorial have <end>
we're going to change just going to be and the flags as it's going to be and again <end>
updates and we're going to give that and we're going to open up to it out make it called this action name is
equal to new remote views and then we refer to a method called c and then we refer to a context again <end>
our row that we have our <end>
you know that variable for this array paths up here read and we're gonna within our class name and then you know that
web <end>
references set up a tab host like this as well find view by d <end>
oncreate method of our in our geo point so we're gonna set up or a geo point so we're gonna set up our
have a <end>
name just some of the background stuff of <end>
class name that we set up a we can set this data object and we're going to let hit our intent which <end>
so there we go and then we're gonna set up just you got that we're gonna say we need to do now we
with it don't actually access where we label this test it loads our <end>
that's going <end>
starting point it and it's going to say <end>
it's when we get boring what we're going to add some edit <end>
gangsters gangstas and you're like that in <end>
going to create a string and we're going to say this method we're going to do is an exception and this <end>
have our switching case which <end>
get projections or <end>
cases so we're gonna refer to our starting y but first what we want <end>
going to affect that we can kind of go over that i just test is and what we can set up in quotations
well but for the most part but after our application looks like interrupted sense what this out with the type array <end>
like we need to do is we want to do is we're going to kind of review <end>
most part which would <end>
guys can do is we need to do is for <end>
class dot parse long and <end>
marketplace so <end>
browse and again we want to do is you're gonna refer to the first <end>
we're going to say our tab specs is we're going to say our tab specs is equal to our tab <end>
class or et which is simply just change our default value i just refer to et which will again be integer and we
for the most part again so hopefully <end>
data class and this type for a option so what we're going to set up our variable is just going to <end>
android dot and then - and then at when people do is change our map so if we want to be clickable because
we're gonna first set it up to our location manager and what we're going to help us <end>
send data we're going to say if it's crazy we're gonna say probably right <end>
then we can return some sort of <end>
up here like okay delete that all we're going to do is we're going to say <end>
to this on progress update so now what we're going to set the external data from <end>
know it's pretty much the same thing again we can choose from so that's going to <end>
class or actually enter uri that ok are having this make sure the zero of the most part it's just talk through like
select eclipse store and then we just copied so again we have <end>
http variable which we call this variable which <end>
running is equal to false now so if this pause method is where is you draw our background we're going to set up
just bitmap on me and what we can pull different random size so we have a delete <end>
that so what we did in <end>
need to still continue again <end>
and then add and that's just to move to <end>
the next tutorials have the json second it's just <end>
exception call it e and all we're gonna do is it's <end>
you know really just cuz hopefully <end>
gl our just gonna say we created called our gl triangle fans that's what we're gonna say our gl triangle fans that's <end>
what we're going to add two text nothing new i love you hold our own at use but you do <end>
you know this to 0 so a big deal with basically you know we can be <end>
in this is within our bitmap first maybe i mean this is where we now basically when we set up our down motion
strings for whatever is just <end>
what we're going <end>
and say public void on skin stuff <end>
we're setting up the view and this is a gl surface view <end>
something's working here so that's what we're going to have some hate mail <end>
well i'm just copy this time and this is one and seconds we're going to perform an <end>
adding to i told you know this is pretty much listener <end>
this z axis we're gonna pull the camera is going to be 0 the y axis 0 the y axis 0 the way
to the computer you can see save file that we <end>
problem real <end>
equal to which is question we're going to say dot set text and then we're <end>
stuff but now what we need to create a method set up here because we need to click that and paste <end>
an id android and then we're going to set this to <end>
gonna you just our what looks working with an overview <end>
that's pretty <end>
to do is just within <end>
we're going to say is going to be able to be looking like that and we're going to refer to as well as
this controller or control yeah controller and add this import and <end>
is we're going to again semicolon and we're just gonna add one to each <end>
thoughts here what i'm gonna do is we're gonna have some of some of <end>
yeah germany or <end>
so there we go and so we're gonna say seekbar for the <end>
it yeah everything's fine and then all we're going to say <end>
drawable object say dot get <end>
i mean we're also going to say crush so we're just going to say <end>
up the sake <end>
we're going to refer to our file name a row id and we're going to set the duration toast and display our string
can see our location manager or extends time instead of a location manager and then scroll up here <end>
main <end>
we want to do in the most part so then what we're going to say <end>
manager which i'll explain what that does here in a second but we're <end>
going to subtract this activity <end>
public boolean and say should override url loading and this is going to be <end>
going to be our menu or something like this thread within our <end>
just import that and then we also have to import that and then we're just going to you know import that and then
everything should work out perfectly so let's just a list we can you can click that we got that we got that we
position positioning for the <end>
what i've what i want but i just hanging out it's the <end>
just going to define it but it's just hit our data class and we're going to set it up real quick it's the
say set <end>
input stream reader or get in our application <end>
some information with that get method through http client that's how you guys can do is we're going to run our <end>
doesn't just flip through them by now it should be a little bit more kind of <end>
need to it as our on create method so all gangster going to be looping so we deal above our bitmap class can
we add that back into our clips we <end>
is go into our on create method and we're gonna say set content view to it down so the most part so just
that's just going to drag and then run our application <end>
we're just going to say extends activity class so we're going to say this client is going to implement <end>
temperature in fahrenheit is 77 you can also you know just say whoa whoa <end>
do is say start activity so we're going to remember but what we're passing or an introduction to plain so yeah <end>
pass in and we're gonna say set up a remote views and we're gonna say string <end>
class and paste it <end>
say like <end>
whatever you guys look at plus id forward slash plus id forward slash a good <end>
as an int because over here in our gen folder our our java just to open that <end>
define it so we're gonna say our thread equals new thread and we're gonna <end>
create dot decode stream as you need to decode stream or decode what is this input stream now <end>
just typing a ray adapter russia <end>
results or something like all so it's going to set up a getting use but just <end>
it d and string <end>
quickly we want our our object to false we <end>
is <end>
the state variable so we're just gonna change our third one it's pretty <end>
also going to change this one to width and this one for width <end>
whatever the text is going to be i wasn't going to scroll to it but okay <end>
down to this new method right here that i what we're gonna do is basically our on for we're gonna say android sdk
click listener and we're setting our click <end>
dot set this equal to be <end>
we call this our view that's the superclass for me so just say this is regular application it's going to hold our emulator
of what the <end>
well i'm just copy this is we're gonna say <end>
click that and also want to keep saying it save as <end>
there again we <end>
we're going to add to start out and the location called d and we're gonna set our counter integer for example what we're
we're just gonna relate to our point index list and then all <end>
that but we can get the next tutorial because again being passed in again basically just set our viewport or if color or
kind of create maybe <end>
also going to implement we're gonna implement the sense something called <end>
browse and again we're gonna say like <end>
really want to be clickable so you can refer to it in java so we're just going to say id <end>
processing speed i know this tutorial is pretty good stuff so this is within our on surface view which is or seventeen something
parameters is we're going to reference our intent again <end>
class implement methods from the phone that's going to do again is probably called on options <end>
overlay so we're gonna set up our <end>
class can go we have a name <end>
it i have the blog here and as a little <end>
kind <end>
self-explanatory of what we set up the <end>
don't want to write to it for the most part so context dot mode private so <end>
going to get <end>
gonna say position so for example or <end>
looking through all this code for where you typed the <end>
just going <end>
it <end>
to be like that to go over and for the most part but we <end>
our audio <end>
the y value our out our sensor x - test let's get basically this <end>
guys kind of a little bit more options we can <end>
going to still for us just again a reference is going to be our emulator doing anything <end>
than the shared preferences and if we're gonna do is we're going to say <end>
to our array and then we're just going <end>
going to set up a <end>
we want to refer to that we learned about us and what service we can say get well so <end>
doesn't really need to do is we're going to go down to but you know for now let's check <end>
we're going to do is we can set up a new constructor for us and then what we're going to set it to
some sort of our overlays anyways and then we're going to do is we're going to show it down here but just make
sorry if i'm going to call this check it out that we're gonna do is set up a couple boolean on the emulator
android and tenth dot set type and we're going to say within quotations <end>
reference and android we can also do like summary let's do enter your <end>
part does not that we set up a file input stream and both of the context of our <end>
array and then we can say <end>
textview fine view by d r dot id dot tv show results or whatever you guys <end>
class so again this is basically and then paste it down more as well first so we're gonna pass in the name that
constructor well basically when we work with not so yeah just allow it within the constructor we're going to use it a graphics
ten dot geo underscore per spekt spective correction hint and then <end>
anyways because uh you know that's where we have <end>
gonna be these call tags here like we've kind of a button is the <end>
first thing we need to do is say request window feature and then we hit <end>
and a lot of <end>
seguin set this up to our audio manager class <end>
we're also going to go there and i'm going to help you have our <end>
that's s dot and then what we're gonna get down into the string we're going to add our url instance of that base
say add a few more gonna add and again with me test as well so it's going to show a few more in
resources are dot id dot i mean our surface tab host dot and then what what you're gonna set up <end>
right click source override implement methods and as you can see there is always a on create methods and as you can see
value so we're going to say android weight sum is the command and we're going to set up <end>
basket so we're gonna say basket and we're gonna just say new <end>
basically the new boston hit enter as and also make <end>
say comm google dot dot add activity so make sure your spelling is correct <end>
click that enter again let's go hitter activity but hopefully it's a string so we'll review <end>
have to import this and what we're going to do is we're going to say get <end>
bufferedreader dot read line and what we're going to create a <end>
and we want to set up and as you can <end>
over to next and then <end>
id so we want you know check it out that's what it's where i <end>
we're going to go over here into our <end>
we're just gonna say refer to you <end>
to do again refer the recognizer intent and we're going to say intent and the key reference is the class that up that
events we're <end>
every time we can say display i'm sorry and gravity to left and then type sinner and gravity <end>
you know you know you might just kind of understand that some sort of like a <end>
position zero and then we're good to go through this by 4,000 el and it's going to say dot as well so again
this constructor is our tutorials ago pretty simple it's basically get the top of this constructor we're we're gonna set and we're all
just gonna say if text-to-speech is not let's <end>
just to set up an int or i'm going to pass in get into a string we're going to set up a method
value or the max volume that we're gonna say seekbar which i don't know mess <end>
within parentheses again the exception type is called class not found <end>
what we're gonna say <end>
say just guess on the amount of our typeface so we want the new boston and what we're going to say <end>
by yourself but we're going to say textview array within our emulator it's gonna have <end>
then we're gonna put a comma and we can say example 1 and then i'm just going <end>
dot set <end>
name again this page if you guys can use the activity i'm just going to say use existing key <end>
information or from we have so we're gonna say info dot set city and we're just going to create a method called city
set up our byte buffer and all <end>
manager so we're going to get <end>
also we created here and also a context so we're going to say add unimplemented methods called our whole application again it's really
going to set up <end>
say is by going to say web or we want to string builder <end>
hit just enter that and then select this email and there we <end>
complicated just make sure we ever we have our references set up the <end>
and we're going to hit finish a <end>
right so that's going to start with with <end>
and we're going to scroll down for on activity result on activity result on activity result <end>
it's a little <end>
just change that <end>
and then we're just going to do is we're going to update the xml layout i don't that i have <end>
where we need to <end>
you can scroll <end>
so you know pay open <end>
and we're gonna say list some <end>
going to go over to it to deal with it so don't want to deal with <end>
this tutorial so we're just gonna say what's up it's up and then what we're gonna do is create <end>
there we have the <end>
to add some <end>
to our dot <end>
current temperature and fahrenheit is equal to put <end>
import overlay class which comes or what we're going to be what we need to do is we need <end>
as you can see it takes flags what we're going to add the <end>
say dot append and what we're gonna do in quotations we're gonna do is we're <end>
again it's kind <end>
took the person can see i mean it's pretty <end>
say this for the for the <end>
have a array list set up and then we want to make sure a request code or i'm just say oh kind of
in our on <end>
going to work and as well <end>
referencing multiple methods so we're going to say new there and basically we're going to call this that <end>
and we're just <end>
know it's <end>
can just place it within there as for the text size right below our button is that we just created <end>
source override implement methods and then i kind of the manifest in the next <end>
variables so what we're gonna do is we're going to say is we're going to say is we're going to say is we're
giving us that first parameter yeah we set up are listed act <end>
stuff but that's where you're going to <end>
shapes or what we've kind <end>
setup here in the next tutorial <end>
url dot or actually let's start a new string we're going to say string <end>
into eclipse org /downloads we're going to create our maps key store for <end>
and kind of handle it as the surface view like a touch screen so nothing new there and basically we're gonna call it
put one of those straight with and we have to set the up into the manifest again like i want and we want
string which we're going to refer to this is a message <end>
guys probably learn how to do is we establish kind of now nothing new there and just create method now and again what
our constructor for <end>
need to set up a tent for minutes we're going to say i don't know and what we want to say if we
do anything so basically this whole folder it's the developer page it so that's pretty basic setup here out <end>
we're just going to say file output stream this and we're going to say string sql view that's spinner and we're going to
click listeners sets to user so basically what we're going se5 basically go <end>
the user of our widget that out what the widget that good for your look for the widget that those things within this
so again we just have three columns even just <end>
gonna be true or not drawing on it within it within the value or <end>
called send <end>
dot start dot <end>
reference so there we go we add another one more looking like this item for the most part so what we're going to
but i mean after you can see hide our keyboard so again once we're done with some sort but so this is we
sure it works and kind of show you guys what i'm gonna go over and it so it basically the whole tutorials and
gonna say custom pin point or class so now it's gonna create a geo point that we now i just pulled up in
up the method <end>
can say can whoops go back so that's going to be like hey can we go back <end>
line it pretty easy and go <end>
holder class and define it in and there we go we are all we <end>
data dot set length <end>
going to do is we just got to the <end>
a <end>
our map or actually let's just hit our satellite view type our status and over in something like when we <end>
whole class we're going to say new my bring back and then we're going to say new my bring back and then we're
we got this coming from a layout so we're pretty much done <end>
it's handle which we worked with it d it's y and <end>
by right-clicking within the brackets going to hover over to a sd dot onclicklistener and then just right-click on create the source and
the whole canvas for the most part so we're gonna say is our surface view <end>
up a new <end>
splash to affect this series mean where we have two <end>
to set this equal to pending intent class dot get activity for the <end>
which i did is within our <end>
our can also want to close now what we're going to click that method and how we can also want to do is
kind of our <end>
activity we're going to <end>
commands within there we <end>
but for the next tutorial <end>
we've set up a title set this set text you go just to it has the next maybe that and hopefully that we
going to say android layout and change all uppercase subtract <end>
to set this to edit text which basically the other thing that we're in display and then it is it's going to again
we're going to do that we're going to <end>
gonna set our hotness edit text to our returned name and then <end>
know everything works all that will be a little kind of type buffer so that's good and <end>
google add-ons and it should be somewhere after we have the third-party add-ons and then we need android quick and we are developing
equal to edit text find you by id again and then edit text find you by id again and then as kind of
button start and change listener to be this so it's pretty pretty simple tutorial again this nothing new make it pass hog like
to copy that up kind of manages the keyboard so this is where <end>
reference it as well now now we can say our test as <end>
know skip over can kind of reference buffers and then again a few center x 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
content view just for us bracket of the oncreate method so we're gonna call this start our as always and then we're going
to work with <end>
it on resume method so we're just going to say contacts get into it but again it so just to actually this is
of the background stuff that's happening the javascript object notation so that we just <end>
permission and we're <end>
create an input stream what we're gonna save now we also need <end>
most part and we need to set up <end>
that string data creates this but basically this is set up in the next tutorial guys that will just run <end>
that's spelled wrong as well who cares stupid things back to our path at right <end>
and we're gonna call this exactly what we called you know this <end>
up our edit text we're called <end>
inflator class so we can use its suite methods and we're going to use just go to the method here that's going to
content view for this but you don't move it to it as well now when we implemented that we created now let's see
right now the <end>
but now what we're going to do is we're gonna say milliseconds seconds and oops no <end>
boolean value was <end>
but for we're just <end>
we're going to say get text again and to string here is we've used the data java just like we actually have <end>
file <end>
save that and then i'm just going to say actually be to be clickable because what we're going to set that equal to
mouse cursor but basically before we extended the next tutorial again we <end>
length of that we need to enable is the short type buffer so what we're going to say we have to double check
tutorial so we're just going to go over into our application and all that stuff that's about the size that's going to say
background as you can get our button we're going to say android layout and then once once we basically that's why we created
say intent our action name again <end>
say st dot close it whether <end>
so we need to <end>
and paste it within our <end>
key was or q is our data and then or q is our base url and that's what we're going to say values
android use its side if you guys everything works what <end>
what we're going to go i <end>
again you guys can <end>
then we're going to do we're just going to kind of read that <end>
within its extras from us the brackets of code in <end>
what data <end>
you <end>
say public void and we're gonna say insert <end>
site here and you know have <end>
we're going to say media player <end>
but you know and then i'm sorry here you know and then i'm going to say android enabled and we're going to say
crap alright so what we're gonna do because there's some easy walkthrough <end>
we're gonna say the go <end>
we're going to say change the most part we're just going to change this just so when i just wanted to be is
import both those and what's up our references now are confirm equals <end>
we're going to do is we're going to say set <end>
to say toast toast dot long length <end>
part we're also going to do sub equals pretty much the same thing i don't know <end>
down to this new method right here what this java class if our on for we're gonna have <end>
click this is looking like basically enter as you go on some other stuff <end>
sure everything works but now what we have the right now and whatever get any airs you guys go with is you're passing
use and then we're just gonna say doing work <end>
quotations again within <end>
home and what we're going to do is we're going to say <end>
gonna say is gonna go but basically add not too late but you can think of it down here it that's actually use
center it as well so we're just going to add we're just going to say android layout gravity equals <end>
only one one tutorial or so how that we're gonna say textview question mark /p results and we're just going to build a
guys to do before but we're just going <end>
say we're gonna set our stride to our buffer since we're working <end>
start and then our event which comes working with and both of the <end>
to basically what the the most part so you know how to this basket or i'm just gonna say basket dot get string
widget config and that's gonna basically widget config and that's gonna basically widget item and then i'm just gonna set up our widget
going to be a buffered exception or <end>
current temperature and fahrenheit is and then space and then now we're just gonna hit enter and all we're going to use our
excuse you guys want to be of the on <end>
what am i said and change it within this linear <end>
host so what we do if we want to specs so we're going to set <end>
for your <end>
now what we can do is do is add to basically you can say you know so we also you can say our
need to send <end>
three or whatever we <end>
falling asleep on you guys here but hopefully <end>
picnic so what to do is set this class name dot and we're going to say put <end>
know something like that so <end>
that's being passed in which we're going to refer to note <end>
menu here and also we want to follow along which is being passed <end>
animation because you can go to then if we kind of confusing i'm going to run our surface view equals you guys saw
tutorial guys is we can write to <end>
password that you guys will remember again your keystore password and we're gonna scroll through what again we're gonna click this key so
guess it's supposed to be a gl surface view <end>
context dot <end>
what actually i kind of set some way you guys in this tutorial because <end>
do is we're going to say our buffered activities that <end>
just say this is equal to new intent and then the package name we're gonna <end>
work with the different way with that gets called this ad is <end>
can even have our edit text to our hot or not class or we're gonna pass in the context of this tutorial i
again it's the same reference make sure those <end>
context again get the data class and then we just set up my data class then we just need to <end>
we're going to delete the entry and we're gonna say textview <end>
so right here so there it takes a little <end>
listener because again this is a class name we're going to now it's it's it's it's it's it's like what this tutorial i
stream volume sir <end>
some sort and again <end>
return so again we're just going to add to <end>
parameters the text so we're going to refer to the nth so we're going to refer to the nth so we're just going
class import and then what we can do is we can do is we can say our request dot <end>
and there we go over to this line is after our object within this we set up our buffer which we have it
so just say <end>
we're going to use this method that <end>
or download from my <end>
up samantha and 7 which is again just you know you can you know we got to <end>
from default webview settings i'm just going to be kind of it is again that's how to be kind of use the first
basically the order that by just for the type we have this basic we need to do is we're going to say gl
within our preferences edit text we set up an intent so we're going to call one within the resources to do is basically
maybe a few more buffer class we're just gonna relate to relate to relate to relate to relate to relate to relate to
and down here <end>
have a good for that is a semicolon and it the <end>
type <end>
that equal to our gl object that so what we're gonna do is we're just <end>
say new hot or <end>
we're gonna pass and we're also gonna paste it as that we want <end>
tutorials like we can get when <end>
quick layout nothing new this tutorial so as you can see it's kind <end>
have to import this above our classes that <end>
the y axis and then scroll up here <end>
for we're going to surround this little method on <end>
going to set up a class variable <end>
worked with that and what would be a textview so we're going to <end>
go back here we insert a semicolon and that's good for now what we're going to do is again <end>
ford ford slash two forward slashes and we can say saving data via <end>
hit enter and then just again it's go up right here called and we're going to reference something from within there in the
what we're dot set length <end>
we're gonna call this like that set up a context so private context can't spell and we're just gonna call this like that
oops did i do that right what am i what oops did i do that right what am i <end>
here in our thread do in our thread my bring back surface class here we use the surface view here so there we
as well so we're gonna say again relate to <end>
sexier and that's for <end>
our starting our final y which happens every time we have our final y which happens every time we have our final y
going to be <end>
most part this time and click that and what <end>
actually this ratio for we're also going to say we want to be see you put it to to our viewport or <end>
say set url and then we can kind of <end>
paste it says <end>
dot the new boston apk just say widget and we're going to do is basically we'll get <end>
and just just going to say our ad and then again just load dot load add view class and just hover <end>
values and then we're going <end>
going to call this to false and then we're just going to set up a dialog so we're going to go down and
temperature in fahrenheit is 77 you can also you know just say whoa whoa <end>
know this as you can see the user so we're going to create a new string and we aren't going to set up
now what <end>
work with a a method called c and we're just gonna add our <end>
also fill the parent for both width equals fill <end>
for the size of our constructor first so what we're gonna do to do so we set up the text size it's probably
activity and then basically your <end>
do anything within the reference to be called results whatever yes we're gonna say new view type instance of the most part so
kind of <end>
bring back surface and we just set up this for this accelerometer again is we're gonna type which is and this sensor is
by going to be method start activity for the most part which is a name that we want to do is we're going
comm dot google dot ads dot ad view like that and we <end>
basket so we're gonna say basket and we're gonna what we're gonna do is we're gonna say our edit text into <end>
call this class <end>
is actually <end>
you you can set it into it an error all right now this video we're going to throw sure it actually that's how
reading so we're going to say result is equal to basically result as well <end>
item whoops if we can just say dot <end>
to set <end>
was our dot xml dot prefs so there we go <end>
passed in as well and then we're passing in that's what we're going to do is create a new boston and then we're
whatever let me pull this over can you go into finder documents android <end>
within our addresses in our location has changed in to be int location <end>
we need to do is we need to pass in a certain key or a unique id and it <end>
creating one it's pretty pretty quickly is we can do it is button it's kind of a string here i created that for
url dot or actually let's start a new string we're going to set this click <end>
guys have a key tool - list - alias android debug key <end>
going <end>
most part to set up a string set our text view which is can't spell right here so you guys remember we do
release other touch event and then you can calculate some kind of velocity <end>
class and again this is great reference to for what setup <end>
class dot get intent that we're just going to say text-to-speech equals zero in like <end>
so that's telling you guys about about play <end>
so under this the application because we also want and then we're also going to add you <end>
or music item position something like that we're gonna refer to the switching case set up an extra prompt on volume so we
setup on resume method and this tutorial is learn how this application again this is the name so i do since we can
classes that <end>
don't want this class and this isn't gonna have any parameters that object alright 1 point 3 so triangle e^x and this isn't
few tutorials ago so we're gonna set up basically we want is pressed then we can kind of <end>
get an intent that has a second it's kind of a second <end>
as you can see here it's labeled event so you say event dot and then we we <end>
the most part boat so think of it just you know kind of how i explained <end>
grabbing the surface we want to it sm <end>
get longitude and if we know hit our progress bar to <end>
we're gonna call this check and then we just set up what we want to do is we're going <end>
what we're going to set that up above our view client something like that variable for a kind of complex here is basically
we're just gonna add our <end>
dress like this and the base class and then we're <end>
finished we're just going to set that picture to the most know the text size so we're going to set that picture to
random object all we're gonna <end>
all that good <end>
so we're going to go above here so we need to create a new <end>
even show you guys just <end>
giving us an error because we can do the most part exception and it extends activity it's kind of review <end>
want to delete that so set up in our <end>
used some sort of method done and just say is gonna <end>
say on you know we can say increment as well but just so we're just gonna say set max <end>
within parentheses again as <end>
click on our thread you know this application hits the new boston <end>
gonna call this text a new text-to-speech is not equal to where it's not too render stuff because it's going <end>
notification and update it so what we're gonna do is we're going to do is we're going to say get <end>
int longy like we're going to set this equal to again casting in <end>
we're going to say new for the internet so we're going to say new for my bring back like a new again <end>
doing our on create method gets called status bar change listener because over to the activity class as well and test and it
anything we're just going to add the <end>
data attached and that we <end>
thoughts here <end>
then what we're going to do is say input type class so we're gonna set type class again within our on oh <end>
that's that's what this and there we go and there we go now every time we it right now we've set it so
sensor event listener and we're gonna extends activity so we're just gonna add show <end>
array array list of the type so we're just gonna call this map <end>
let's kind of move these brackets down you guys want to <end>
text to our new string variable that will be set text and we're going to say dot set text to our new string
point 1 4 last point it was negative 1 in the x direction and negative 1 in the x direction so same so
stop variable is equal to again system dot current time and there we go i <end>
should say so again if things classes so now that is gonna be equal to our string a new string and we're <end>
for the most <end>
ad request we're just going to call this ad is also set up our ad view <end>
nebraska or whatever the person searched for so we're gonna have say <end>
and so once we go basically this reason i should do private if you want string we're gonna set up a toggle button
the id of our set up a test text now when we're just going to set that equal to our radio group and
is we're gonna do is we're going to set up this for this activity to kind <end>
let's scroll down to our simple browser and type in a website again <end>
we're going to say return our our http get which was kind of a <end>
but if statement <end>
that's going to add that in this tutorial and just getting the right there we go but i think to within the right
being passed in as important <end>
but we're just going to we're <end>
marketplace you go into our application <end>
to the reference because once we <end>
but anyways so that's basically the <end>
webview client as well so now what we want <end>
every time we hit create it so what we're going to create here or this so what we also want to set up
button so we're going to add subtract <end>
visuals go surface tab and we're going to add <end>
lines and we're going to select <end>
ever image we want to say get read input stream now <end>
have to do is <end>
title we're gonna refer to that we <end>
class and it's going to define some <end>
our file name which is <end>
doesn't really describe them too <end>
then and that's <end>
again alright hopefully everything works now but i'm just about the other type well then we started but the purpose i don't get
and then we're gonna use our handle which we called <end>
this method and again this is what we're going to <end>
that's spelled wrong as well who cares stupid things that this person does <end>
uses permission and we can scroll through some of the permissions that <end>
within here we're going to refer to our data results and again we're just going to set it as well and then we're
start watch break and then we're going to say our our slider or our slider or our slider or our slider <end>
gonna change our class to be able to any higher than <end>
key tool - list space - <end>
location and now what we're going to go back over that out and we're going to go down here now i should be
direction and we just gonna call this point <end>
we're going to do is we're going to call this menu or or something like that we're going to be is not going
how we just want to set equal to equal is going to build kind of our own application and kind of because i
all over to our first one called and set <end>
started with this so we're actually info or some stuff you ever brand new boss and there we go over to the way
of our file put in our <end>
and then enter from this entry according to that and we're going to say is we can set it to our get information
service and what service do we want to get well we want to <end>
preferences again that we just set up a new id or something like that then got set up in our menu class called
it's gonna draw our triangle or vertice oh yeah we're gonna relate to it can go over to a little bit for some
that we're going to look for and then all we're gonna do is refer to be doing work now we have we set
a tent such as position something like that we're gonna refer <end>
explosion and set <end>
set the content view so tv can read through these can all that so we're just going to set up this is just
and again we can just for file all we want is and float too <end>
explosion and for a priority again told us say one for future capability or <end>
guys have <end>
we need to set up the emulator because there we check email with the android manifest and then end menu we're just gonna
into our button up <end>
gonna <end>
saying hiding the keyboard after using an edit text so that's how you basically you can do it is going to be is
as we want to you know as we want to you know add our short buffer and again we're just gonna insert our
have three something where this is pretty good stuff we have three text views so yeah that's <end>
then just right here all upcase and then all over everything that's kind of breaking intent <end>
kind of have you know whatever are drawable and that's going <end>
boston travis dot starting point and then <end>
that to be true as well instead of if we set it to that we do <end>
to that enter and then open some stuff so basically this tutorial is kind of <end>
d something like that or just say new dialogue <end>
<end>
you are kind of readjust be true now and nothing too well and basically i don't know we <end>
close our buffer reader so if we <end>
asking is new map view i should say kind of in some of our main class so we're going to go to here
just going to hit enter a spacing we're passing or it <end>
for example and the y-direction then also want to create a 3d <end>
but takes a bundle within its parameters click ok and we have our menu just again the errors don't worry about that <end>
finish this class so we're going to set <end>
and as you can see it's like that but that's what we're going to go over <end>
have to set up a new new set up as well so if we <end>
and let's check that in and these buttons can't then here but keep track of what we need to add our <end>
just need <end>
class and we're doing is create method called <end>
again alright hopefully everything works now but uh alright that's better <end>
just create a variable we're gonna say hey we're gonna call <end>
sometimes when i do tutorials like this so we're going to say <end>
variable that we just created called media scanner you know mess around with the <end>
we're doing is <end>
to want our dialog so what we're going to <end>
going to google maps and we're going to go into it can't do you pretty quickly in that you <end>
going to say button and button stop dot set on <end>
a simple simple stopwatch application so fine view by id <end>
hit that and then at once it's <end>
because we <end>
there's invisible if we want to add subtract and there's visible so we can pick simple switching case and we're just going to
dot and so we're also going to kick them down <end>
can get the signup page which <end>
setup here so now what we're going to use this is just going to go into our xml and now what i got
second so basically we get the <end>
just going to try and i don't learn that i might just getting a <end>
so it's going to do is we're going to do is we're going to add that 10 that but i will in the
class called can set up a textview so we're gonna set <end>
can r equals true and lastly can w equals can r equals again we did with with with and then can we can
keyup but again for a modify or no longer by just going to <end>
shoot information as a little bit we've learned in the context so we need to move this time and then always simple stuff
quotations we need to import that called starting to our starting point and then what we can type new <end>
it just so far and then set button for argument the <end>
websites my bring back calm so basically our program for the most part doesn't really need to have our drawable that's about the
and then we can say our blue dot set set color to again color dot <end>
so we're going to <end>
is where we might say our buffered reader as well we do so we're going <end>
activity that is this action <end>
this comes from our activity class so we need to set up our <end>
the oncreate method and <end>
click that again just click that file to basically what <end>
is equal to our drawable <end>
graphical view we're going to do is we're going to say for right here then we're going to lay <end>
scanner connection dot this air right here so we're going to <end>
set up something here to go down here and then we're going to do is <end>
image we can do is we want <end>
we're just gonna print a new line again just backslash <end>
all we basically that's how we were working i'm sorry i got <end>
oh yeah i'll just make sure everything works <end>
we're going to do is again in our <end>
going to go over through all set up like 45 pixels and it's a <end>
guys and i don't really like the manifest again i applied to this is <end>
so we're going to say get the power manager within our class so we're going to say get system service and we're going
check state something like that and that's not sure i don't know <end>
we're gonna do is see it <end>
think i love you so that's how we're working i'm getting our <end>
messed up a <end>
we're going to set up our button within that layout again nothing new here <end>
simple switching case that we're all so familiar familiar with get <end>
so what we want to <end>
can't <end>
little bit better <end>
we're going to change that will be is pulling that object so we have some sort <end>
and we're gonna <end>
going to <end>
let's <end>
axis and if we are drawing to do is we want <end>
again <end>
to set a cursor we're going to say key underscore row 1 1 even just say again refer to our string array and
also gonna set up a title so we're going to pass in very basic android dot and we need to run <end>
doing anything so then all we're gonna do is create this class and we're gonna say public of a <end>
going to hold our first item so we <end>
plus id forward slash and then et for this one button and then android actually we're just going to go through all that
say if <end>
surface called simple if that in java how that's how to override menu and we're gonna paste that within the <end>
since we're reading that class is we're going to put this variable handling xml reader which is we're going to read some more
things and how we do that is just type c as well we're going to hit <end>
nebraska or whatever the person searched for so we're gonna have say kind of three <end>
probably still want to you guys again let's just kind of <end>
be of these of <end>
released when you know have a starting point <end>
gonna say flippy and the standard default shared <end>
we want <end>
that won't drawing to it so sm here which i moved down <end>
set up and the <end>
but for the next tutorial and then you know the right here i need to do is we can read or something like
time and then basically be which i will be able to one of our whole class called our typeface we need to do
into it an class so we're going to call this array because again it's gonna right there we go we can right and
toggle button and find you by id this is kind of a repetitious tutorial <end>
tutorials that just makes me really create or makes me just paste it down you guys to get some information or makes me
but for the tutorial really <end>
package name so we can use some of the <end>
set up through the second we're actually going to <end>
again just kind of <end>
more <end>
pause or we're gonna cast it in as an int because that's just like a location l or the thing we're gonna do
the <end>
say get prefs or this if it's going to be our action name so we're going <end>
equal to <end>
or i said <end>
here for a key we just need to update our database according to that whatever <end>
makes some sense <end>
clockwise as well so we can go now of those i have <end>
going to introduce this intent because this is right now the starting point it's gonna shoot over to that android use its data
is we're just going to be it some data back we're going to be is we're just going to be keyboard we have
you guys are we can do is we're going to go up our references make sure i added some xml so keep that
we're going to go through here paste it where you guys want and set up some stuff within our emulator real quick so
dull lately they haven't been selected listener we need to do what's ever within here we have in case here i know these
reference for emulator starts it's a <end>
recognition class again the recognizer intent and then <end>
method <end>
something like that and import bitmap and then again from the bitmap factory <end>
getting the list list array in your oncreate method here so we're basically going to add unimplemented methods so i we're done with
say and then we refer care about that we created called add to these series just run it make our method or at
view class called <end>
none of those in so let's say new paint this and run this <end>
don't that to <end>
activity class variable setup called our song all we have to do now is do our song and then we need to finish
something like that or actually this is import d where man it's just for your second so now what we're going to say
our line and we're just going <end>
this tutorial is just copy or cut and <end>
basically going to make sure you guys can set up <end>
this equal to new custom pin <end>
sdk within this droid mode and this we're checking and if you guys to do is right here now we're going to leave
just show you guys how that gets called it what <end>
indicator and then we need to say new <end>
the new boss <end>
create a little bit <end>
we're going to say view flipper we're going to say view flipper we're going to say view flipper we're pretty much done is
variable called set up a variable down here has an error some time and we're going to refer to it right here right
an int we're gonna call this check and again you just gonna say like this to be our <end>
there and <end>
we go we got some <end>
than let's say 20 whoops i is less than 20 and we're going <end>
going to <end>
location we're gonna call this location l or location <end>
the pretty much the <end>
what we're gonna say gl dot gl gl gl gl gl <end>
it's gonna be a power manager and we want to do <end>
internet data and this is going to throw an exception so now that we have <end>
this method so let's define it an within our oncreate method but that's for our whole class so we're gonna first set it
we're going to delete the entry according to which row we want to you <end>
going to subtract for that set up now basically like new here just be a new and now be a pending intent which
to our in your whole class that holder to the view class here so what we're gonna do is we're going to say
guess it's the value of it as you guys <end>
be from the <end>
database or close <end>
regular activity that <end>
the pending <end>
and it where you guys want go to be <end>
and you'll save <end>
we're gonna set this up here so we're just <end>
save that point other classes can be just you know this get this add our that's available there and then we <end>
what kind of going to be a text so <end>
going to say set up so we're going <end>
toggle button and find you by id this is kind of a repetitious tutorial <end>
but i <end>
add a <end>
we're going to say surface view <end>
a table <end>
can do is we can say float center center x is equal to again our canvas dot <end>
that whole thing so what we're gonna say get out of our drawable equals it as our on create method for this series
enter your emulator so for we're actually xml i'm going to do is we're going to say inactivity when we paste it kind
quickly kind of review here but you know the table layouts something a little <end>
have to set buttons text so we're gonna say new dialog <end>
to do <end>
we're going to do is just that's basically be is from the <end>
stream max volume and then we're gonna say int for the most <end>
gonna say upload were set the content view up over to the id again it's going to <end>
for some of code within this because 100 we want to scroll down for the java or something else so we're going to
table name which <end>
going to go i show you guys so it has parentheses that so that's going to use a bitmap actually let's jump over
going to google <end>
going to set up our constructor we're gonna set up some <end>
since again it's just for the id and there we go and that's kind of desired result we and you actually be pretty
what we're going to do is set up a radio group we're just going to work it's going to say dot set onclicklistener
but basically when we <end>
gonna say gl gl just say we're going to say gl gl just say we're going to say gl gl just for the
reference that called an intent which was <end>
i'm gonna run method called it by probably accept this license explaining or i mean <end>
dot set up we're going to just change this back <end>
this up our first bitmap is we're gonna copy <end>
permission tab here in the android manifest and the android manifest and again <end>
we're going to use a method again or a <end>
gonna say if and within parenthesis we're gonna say music equals true <end>
starting point make it an array to be a string name that class so that's we're going to say is our list as
reference it so what we're gonna do is we're gonna say locale dot get zoom with it so we can add the base
do we have our button within that on pause method <end>
and we're going to say our milliseconds or mils like that and this l ong dot set variable name dot set <end>
we scroll up but some variables back equal to zero and kind of the <end>
we're just gonna be <end>
different methods and we're just going to say create this class and so <end>
list nothing new there and we're going to say set the type <end>
can just said we can say <end>
know it's <end>
can do is have a catch <end>
what we're going to do is set up a not something like <end>
we can make it work and then we're done i don't know type dot current time equals below <end>
going to write to our database and then everything else if <end>
now it's going to shoot down to that onclick listen <end>
an int we're going to say static final result email intent i don't know it's kind of parsing class which we <end>
java we're going to do <end>
over to next and then over here so i don't know or it is we set <end>
based off that dot get position and what we're going to refer to our address list so now what we set <end>
we're going to <end>
gonna get the motion event dot action down again <end>
to run basically the email so again refer to this <end>
confirmed button and for save button we just have <end>
gonna say our <end>
and paste <end>
shorts so that's pretty time you guys don't worry about that we you know how <end>
center we're going <end>
runnable so we're working <end>
up auction method gets called or jenny you want the most part is set up in and then we had this as right
to change this to copy it kind of describe what's ever get an id so that's going to say android layout width equals
we're just going to do is we're going to just like <end>
new string array within our array xml is what we're going to set that up real quick and we're just gonna say if
configuration already knows <end>
send data we're going to say these are kind of this tutorial anyway so <end>
class so what we're going to do is we're going to scroll down to our class and then we just set up a
save some are four something like that we're going to set <end>
is you can see it takes four paths or you can see it be and to basically just set up here the <end>
with so we're gonna say r and there we go with our splash activity the <end>
stuff here i'm going to paste it <end>
we're working with a constructor for a float buffer since we're working with this point index array or list we're going to set
class real quickly and off of our <end>
or we're going to <end>
classes so i'm just gonna say <end>
in the first tutorial let's just run our file up that so basically we can say file name and then we can set
part from our file input stream which will match this means that we set up here and does is exactly what it's <end>
layouts one for the portrait so basically all this is what we're going to set up and then it's going to test hit
we're going to say android layout height but you know android layout height but then we're going to say android layout height but
stuff so what we're going to do is we're going to say get <end>
voice and for our listview say lb voice return so just maybe that we've done with i'm sorry r dot and paste it
it's going to set up <end>
say you type that the <end>
what we're gonna say <end>
release other touch event so i'm just set up a simple if else or if statement so we're going to say within <end>
again it's called sliding drawer it's a set their thing <end>
our their screen here we need to <end>
again a plus bitmap <end>
the most part we can go into where we're gonna call this variable font cuz you know so if this is <end>
so i want to do is we're going to call it an or email that <end>
we're going to set it <end>
it's just about implementing and it's a name again it's going <end>
oops and then the settings of you're like that then just say achieve dot this one we're going to achieve some of some
like this is we're going to perform an set <end>
have to set up a reference bridge so we're just going to say add view <end>
going to add to set up basically going to say string integer and start with through <end>
the most part you know again just say create method for all the row for here the first row id we want to
increment by one and now what we're gonna say geo only going to be able to basically like that and now what we're
there it's man such a great read so if you know the http forward slash <end>
we're gonna work with our controller zooms <end>
what we're going to do <end>
whatever this is kind of a random and then we refer to that we're gonna <end>
we're gonna <end>
called time i believe i do that by 4,000 el and then we're going to <end>
variable <end>
with this is going to delete the first little <end>
this to true and <end>
going to do in the entity <end>
and then scroll up <end>
string is create this with i'm sorry here and you know it's not going to be equal to our info or edit text
but i mean it's going to go <end>
that as for example if it i said just backslash <end>
shared preferences and hit paste it text because again we get <end>
scrollview in there i think about it so we're just going to go above our paste this method called a reference just going
value of the nth so we're just going to set up basically the value of our integer which <end>
just kind of a lot of things that and then we ever brand new with with the xml here and for the new
keyboard after we go now we we pretty much it <end>
the class we can use that and <end>
something like media player mp equals media player dot set our widget dot create and context <end>
format it and then we're just going to throw in some random crap so be <end>
class so we're going to add unimplemented methods like that we set <end>
just gonna hit finish and this by yourself but hopefully we need to call the <end>
little chunk of <end>
accelerometer so let's you know the methods that yeah it's gonna add show <end>
put one of the 8 so make sure <end>
basically display and this here and there we go now this is is we do is we're going to call it so again
if that's done so we are good to do for again we again we're gonna say resume and then we still need to
sure everything works and then we're going to do is we need to do it will change is getting the android tutorial for
send data we're going to say if it's crazy we're gonna say probably right <end>
to the new boss and also we set up basically what we're going to set up a class variable called class or i'm
so how we've render x and we're just gonna do is we're gonna paint we're basically <end>
again your keystore password and like a password it's <end>
set our onclicklistener and we're just going to say this as well now <end>
we can choose <end>
by two bytes <end>
going to be <end>
relate to our list that we don't have the same name <end>
add our imports and there we go <end>
spinner and find view by id rg <end>
there we go and then we're basically gonna say android sql open <end>
say extends default handler and then x <end>
we can also we need to say is basically what was all we want to <end>
going to be activity and we're <end>
gonna say int max now we're gonna set <end>
get well so again if you're <end>
but we're gonna have an app widget <end>
so the android layout land it's going to basically <end>
this class so we're going to refer the activity so what we can you can comment out all we you know the class
you then what we say <end>
save that and we can say changing <end>
blow our gl 10 class dot gl underscore color array and now that we've quickly and <end>
hit our semicolon and finishes again we're getting this on <end>
set this <end>
we want to have <end>
we can type so now what we're going to do is we're going to need to do is we're going to set up
gonna say get x and we're also going to say info something like that file name and we also need to create method
promise you you will be which i this int and again we actually set up which was being passed in again we actually
we're going to have et url and we're going to <end>
so basically we just say f here so now what we can do within our save file up here and basically <end>
most part so we're gonna set our value is gonna set text dot get string <end>
refer to this there and hit ctrl-v and you go over here then we need to <end>
and we can read through this table we're going to paste it within our get the same row id <end>
listener and then we're just going <end>
would just compile on top right and check that and i'll just throw one other because again the frame layout <end>
get the 8 api level and we want you choose another key stores or <end>
to be called key points so now what we're going to call this integer array i'm sorry and we've worked <end>
going to copy this integer so what we're gonna do is we need to do is basically going to do is our load
to say negative 1 / top value we're going to say just for example 0.5 <end>
gangster-style just going to <end>
then we're also going to say dy is equal <end>
to center but you guys don't really <end>
going to set this equal to our variable in case then we can do is just right here or something like that we're
lastly case two and again a little bit were mean is just copy and then just a random and random and random and
that we're going to set up our weather api package name is where we're going to say our dot and we're going to
right here we need to create a password that <end>
have to import this many <end>
data dot context make sure all <end>
or not class or object we're going to call it x i don't know new hot or <end>
need to do so so after we did this is not and now basically got some stuff this is not basically what we
quotations at plus id /m v format view main something like that in the most part if everything that's <end>
internal data chicken is array and lastly learned about going to copy and now what we need to add some stuff i called
through everything because it's just going to paste that <end>
set the something else that's why i like it works real quickly the sdk as we go <end>
going to say our text that we <end>
this does that we got some <end>
button right after our go over to our xml file kind of clean up your code and get things organized a little bit
going to do it anyways basically before we get started i want to make sure <end>
thoughts here and it loads our <end>
home and now what this <end>
just create a variable we're gonna say hey we're gonna create a thread we're gonna <end>
is again a row id we just have three columns that's going to say integer so integer and then <end>
you guys that if you how to be zero for the most part even if we <end>
can we can also created which is it's going to be which is if it but you guys can always read over here
setup here so what this does is the initial layout here is where i don't even want <end>
we're just going to say touchy class touchy <end>
get we're going to set up http response we're going to <end>
the http forward slash forward slash wwe new boston or something like that <end>
have to do is go we've been example have to work with the stuff we're just going to <end>
little <end>
main dot you know some of <end>
then what we're going to do is we're going to do a door in ports and that's the <end>
we're going to set up a geo coder is and then we're <end>
we want <end>
as you can now i know those in that email i know there's never going to hook him kind in this actual target
it's going to again <end>
quite a few for a textview there's one called text size so we're going to get that equal to fill parent i'm sorry
say like that <end>
power manager <end>
accept all or whatever install <end>
our square and what we need to do one method here <end>
format it and then we're just going to throw in the most part and then we're just going to throw in some random
and we're going to say surface view it's basically <end>
then import it out it and first item <end>
say <end>
button right travis and now let's go over to or something like this coming up our textview and another one text view down
touching the surface and everything is gonna be perfect i guess i know <end>
this as long or q is we can just say key underscore name and then we just have to call this value of
we want to create something like this as you can add to the end of this tutorials so it's a method and then
gonna say check and we also i'm just going to value so what we're gonna do is say check and we also i'm
there and then i'm just going to make one up what we're gonna set <end>
this switching case new for example and each list item here so there we go now when we did shared preferences within this
gonna kind of the first thing we want <end>
progress update here and then we're just going to be protected void on progress update so now what we're going to <end>
and again i which we want to show you guys should and you know our home screen and as you can see it
and setup here and the methods so nothing too much it <end>
starting y zero our first plus you know this if our four hundred which happens every time we're also going to do is
our dot parse information into from these more sense so we can just make sure everything for a catch method <end>
the first thing i want you know start with it as i have <end>
be for application right here which are called <end>
constructor well basically when we work with not so <end>
the new boston setting up the new layout here <end>
and check that <end>
url dot or actually let's start a new string we're going to say string <end>
send data we're going to say these stuff this these are kind of the for sending data we're going to set send data
than let's say 20 whoops i is less than 20 and we're going <end>
go back so we can say go back so we can say open file this is a method type <end>
see all that stuff so it's looking for is we're going to kind of remove or i <end>
set up our variable we want to the on initialize method here and then what <end>
dresses type so we're going to do in the last tutorial so we're gonna say geo <end>
we're gonna be <end>
breath for reference points and then we're going to say this is a reference and the solve in the next tutorial we're gonna
basically all we need to be event dot what we're doing tutorials we're just going to say throw an int and then also
surface view here and again we're just going to pass in mind all <end>
we're just going to do is <end>
here's all we can refer to have we're gonna say android and hit enter and we also want to have to have <end>
and now that for you <end>
actually closing so now we can set up that column we're going to say <end>
protected data protected void on pre execute and again we can refer <end>
string going when you won't also going to open <end>
update media update files for the user to use a row 1 and then our file so we're <end>
just go over and stop activity i don't have so what we're gonna do is going to hold our program i told you
dot let's not do we go <end>
we're just going to say again like try <end>
explanation on the frustum and <end>
within our <end>
geo coder is gonna be able to get some information like the dress <end>
think we've <end>
flag of some sort but hopefully so now what we're going to say edit text we want this edit text so we're going
let me go over to get that <end>
teaching as well so it because you will well height what's going to be whatever you know where you know but you can
class we set up a textview to create something like you guys how <end>
that we wanted to say <end>
then we're creating a new overlay so <end>
what we're going to do is create a new boss in state and now it's going to go quickly set the text so
package explorer now but i'll just get around with it so now what we're going to do is you're small still in the
onclicklistener so we're going to say new tab dot set <end>
so you click that stuff but all that over can see how <end>
you guys don't know that's where we set up and this stuff i downloaded is going to go with the satellite view it's
class that's up our widget so since i'm going to affect this i hover over here it's basically when you won't need that
so let's just clipped the video because i said delete our first thing i said i said just kind of <end>
into setting that out here right here into setting up references right away but don't make it a toggle button we can again
excuse me go back <end>
width and fill parent for a text view etc that's how the video <end>
surface holder so tight and we're gonna call <end>
guys welcome to my you can see <end>
gonna do now is basically i'm gonna do now is basically i'm gonna go to the place where i downloaded this <end>
is 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
that is going to be the app app widget id something like that we're gonna <end>
view which we call show result and this is from the other type that <end>
again it's the problem that working with this <end>
to say our l equals relative relative layout find view by d r dot id dot <end>
say sd there and this file name is basically the first button <end>
for us and then all we're gonna do is refer to be doing work <end>
turn and then down below we're going to say return true and then semicolon <end>
to it over so pretty much so what i forgot which you some <end>
class so there <end>
what we're going to do whatever is <end>
within our exit back to that it basically to do is just like <end>
you know handling stuff yeah down here and then all <end>
have our adapter and do we're just gonna set <end>
to import our class implement the activity class <end>
going to <end>
if you guys can find <end>
i'm going to put in an email and test it out my email if you guys want to send <end>
in it so that's just some then you guys probably already this <end>
it's going to throw in there and then edit it will <end>
to equal to null so now what we want to this yet what we want to this yet but also we're going to
xml ns ads equals and then we have this equal to the xml <end>
now we're going to do is set up within our on click method in our statement as well we can say set gravity
simple i just kind of a code to your layout <end>
that's what it's like that the xml layout we're going to go over to this in the <end>
used for now what we want <end>
have four paths <end>
tutorial we're going to say <end>
going to set <end>
activity so we're just gonna say you can like that so it's listener <end>
dot set text you guys kind of a good stuff this works <end>
notification setup and the package name and again just say new notification and then <end>
classes activity this again is where we kind of set <end>
person carry the backpack now within our oncreate <end>
that this doing that's <end>
going to do is now what these i'm actually that's for this tutorial is we i created now what i said <end>
there's one so you ever we just two so they're id so we're just going to be what we are in this tutorial
what's up so how we do that equal to your clips toggle to look like that equal to your clips and <end>
within this tutorial and just set up our viewport we set up a little bit so this is going to go over is
break to set to <end>
the folder again our indices all three anything well this application pretty simple pretty quickly talk about that makes sure it won't work
sure you're within this part of the activity line and then we're just gonna say keyboard hidden and to be the white background
thing we can do that's it <end>
within you know we'll probably almost added it within our configuration going to add our widget xml file or our widget provider and
that we got our jar for the most part <end>
we've used a few times now i believe and we're gonna say context dot <end>
say again <end>
i learned on linear layout there's padding all over <end>
refer to my path so we can either getting the first one we're just going to follow along for the next <end>
set that equal to beer at content and maybe android height that height to have to have one class so i'm just gonna
they can see the most part of <end>
downloads for the most part and then within this <end>
but since it's not <end>
for the most part what we've defined so what we're creating some view and it's going to listener here it's not found and
android and this isn't <end>
everything within <end>
i had an age in there i'm just going to do is hover over to our hot-or-not class i set <end>
the bundle i was kind of messing around with this reference to that we set up a toggle button is <end>
now when we started now when we started with the way that <end>
and that's how you basically if <end>
methods for the most part oops i'm sorry our theme is equal to work is <end>
so there we go we want to <end>
know this get method called data so all that data and what we're going to do we're going to <end>
whatever that works then what we're gonna do is we're just gonna say this touch screen <end>
where you guys go over that and if we can go over there <end>
browser our dot xml dot view dot prefs so we need <end>
it doesn't really need to <end>
gonna say from the pause from what <end>
a string variable which again our string array list set up <end>
and then we're going to say <end>
lastly case and then we set up so we're going to give us <end>
told you guys to our <end>
whoops or pinpoints and we're gonna set <end>
interrupted air i'm sorry interrupted exception what i was doing that's <end>
we're just going to say final static string and then we just created e^x we're going to say new a parameter the json
touch listener so we're gonna say implements on touch listener we're also gonna do is we can do is we can do on
but for example if we can for my check that for example if you just flip through http forward slash forward slash wwe
and what i've <end>
nonsense but all that craziness so what i've done with it so now we need to just makes sense when they select java
up this variable which we created and then we need to look for us and then we're just like we have this get
cleaning up some of <end>
into it an id we also want to set up let's <end>
point so we're gonna say touch point and then what which isn't the geo point here add this overlay item so we're just
our data no no no i kind of understand that execute again r for example and paste <end>
that's basically <end>
within the take picture switch in case it you guys pretty familiar with that <end>
starting point make it an array you want to add two <end>
above our on create method called show results and we need <end>
we need to do is we need to pass in a certain key or a unique id and what we need to do
going to set this to <end>
and we're going to say basket dot get string and then we just have <end>
address list so now what we're gonna do is we're going to say get the get statement like our longitude or get <end>
data something like that so that's what data something like that so we created called shared preferences and hit paste and then we
so i don't know if you guys want <end>
with it in the <end>
our thread just felt like that we're gonna skip box just felt like that we're going to get six because we open up
byte buffer class and we just need to change our constructor to cube <end>
the take a method we're gonna set up a rate we're gonna say set content view to is not and we refer <end>
a constructor is it within our on create method <end>
display something like that or show so we're also <end>
webview here find view by id and then we're just going to say our dot we're going to say http ford slash forward
as well but hopefully you guys kind of understand that it's it's not <end>
import both those and what's up our references now are confirm equals <end>
is where we update and now everything works and now let's just run it looks welcome to the first way <end>
going to introduce a few new items for a string by right-clicking as well we're gonna <end>
means is going to copy this so you guys know the <end>
going to be again event dot get x and f y our title to our final y is gonna say get action up
we're going to say check and then we can say if equals center <end>
to be <end>
just like when we're just going to say add view <end>
center it as well but what we're going to say android references the whole xml thing by now the add just like your
we're gonna create a new <end>
up then we can switch over to the javascript so it's going to run it works but that's how to my located here
we're just gonna say if since it's <end>
reference it so we set up here and then that's pretty much mail as a little exception dress like set the type so
along for our package name but we're just going to call this google maps <end>
we <end>
the developer page which you through those and we're going to do is we need to save it in google maps and then
familiar they're thinner on create method we might say client it's equal <end>
basically going to <end>
is we're going to say dot id dot i mean it's not really have a reference it's <end>
we're gonna call this n and <end>
what this means here it's basically if everything working with the most part so <end>
to do is go we basically what we want to do is create called <end>
the screen starts of <end>
actions that will set our fx and f y our final y is gonna be <end>
implements location listener like that and again we just have to hover <end>
first for the <end>
concept but what we're going to create our project down <end>
set up a new string and we're gonna <end>
few different not too complicated of our array we have our drawable folder here and you guys can see there and then we're
the sensor event listener we're <end>
class but just to show you guys maybe leave a comment example setting <end>

initially so x our gfx surface and you're like kind of a view variable variables sx for starting x point sy for our
have on <end>
string and it's given us <end>
just going to delete the last tutorial so i created so what we need to say our database according to that we pray
variables some stuff within this method here we set that we get that f and we're going to refer to the method but
what we want <end>
like a good <end>
has an action name so we're going to refer to our intent was not going to return <end>
options here and then scroll down to the bottom and you <end>
if this has a purpose what we're going to do is we're going to say button we say th which is the first
like <end>
called e get action is we're gonna <end>
parameters we're going to <end>
return so we're just going to add is whatever language is going to pass in our entity which we call the e and
say kind of time get the jar to it and here and the city comma parsing and what we're going to show you
know whatever the moment but that's the version something like that and just kind of that again we're just going to say <end>
basically here again it's called our splash class by saying not variable is only recognized within our oncreate method here for this will
we're also going to do is call our text and not null we could have had this set up as you can see
so you know i just change this now but yeah just kind of code you're just <end>
simple we're just going to go over to our linear layout which we gave the one thing is what we're going to say
will allow us to we're going to call this or actually just say again <end>
we did so we're going to say string we're going to set up a <end>
everything i'll get any information from so you just follow along and and then we you know this but we're just going to
what we that equal to the <end>
maybe like plus our sensor x or actually you know we you know we want to import bitmap <end>

on <end>
going to hit plus here and hit dot create and one for our sql use an database as you can say we have
creating this so we say th which is where we need to do is <end>
going to perform an <end>
more doing in our <end>
all we're going to set up a new intent i which is going to do is add all we're going to copy this
a toggle button in our on create two cases within our onclicklistener before we created a toggle button in our on create method
we modified at the beginning and then no alert string reference that there and there we <end>
put extras because you guys can kind of a <end>
going to say public canvas because again is basically we're gonna <end>
key name is question than one will be even though and that's going to basically set up a default value again get we're

we're going to change the label this one here and we're going to say android padding and basically all that good we want
going to give this one thing is basically our application bracket <end>
just <end>
here so <end>
android name is equal to android dot up wit again dot provider and we're <end>
to be a reference to our imports and change it can find it <end>
say towers we're going to say if location we're gonna call this location l or location and then we're passing in the <end>
created a on create what this as you can see if we have to set the to you know some of some sort
going to be from <end>
what we want this string that let's check out well right now we're going to reference to that let's check that and don't
and they kind of go we're going to work with the signup recognition <end>
say final and then just again it's going to set <end>
solve that problem but we're just do that loads over here on update so we're just say we go there again we go
so basically you know another key is our file and say <end>
resource folder we're going to click that you down <end>
running it's equal to true and that's kind <end>
we defined it within <end>
of those classes and our <end>
statements you can see them both here basically enter your xml and then type it twice whatever you want to <end>
make a problem oops as you can <end>
then i believe i have we can use weights there's a code for a scroll view and basically that <end>
shoot it to import and we're going <end>
that's a new boston <end>
saving we can do is again we can have our string so we're going to say as well we did i mean these
sensor <end>
now we have that good stuff so we're just gonna <end>
some information from so we're going to refer to read some sort of an overview of a <end>
right now but if this exception but what was it up real quickly <end>
class which is going to kind of an activity so <end>
that's how to xml so there we go we just need <end>
browser we just hit upload and again we need at least two so the example <end>
want to set this <end>
linear layout there's padding all over to speak up or just want and change your <end>
tutorial we're going to set this variable equal to our some data <end>
up now <end>
i call this over our controller zooms <end>
going to do is <end>
tutorial i know the first change <end>
gonna say our dot r r this we're gonna set this equal to our audio manager dot <end>
say put some reference but that's how you guys should have your setup because it's going to just put like this code from
this ratio for we're just to <end>
layout width equals fill parent and android layout height is going to <end>
we're going to say show results <end>
xml so i've edit text within <end>
shoot it as and there we go through the context of this as and it's just because again our new variable called our
get name and paste it within our update entry so now what we can set to set to <end>
going to say int for integer and camera data and we're actually going to set it up in our data class or will
and they click on walk through the methods with and we're gonna be able to click that in and type is just gonna
everything's okay again just say just like <end>
fill parent as well all right so we're going to close this where we have our scroll view again or know thinking about
like this new <end>
so we're just gonna say dot <end>
layout and create something to include that now what we you know why but i'm going to scroll all of our on create
going to go that's for our resources and you can click that <end>
much the same concept there so <end>
width and for a layout weight value is going to say add one <end>
and that's done and paste the break it's not equal to true so it's going to use the <end>
change the label the button we're going to set that equal to android padding to be what we want to lay it to
do is we're gonna create a file input stream now so we're gonna just say <end>
gonna say gl triangle dx <end>
change it and there we <end>
there and again what we're gonna do is we're going to say our surface view to be set up here and what <end>
what we're gonna do is we're gonna say new alert dialog and then we need is <end>
reference that and we're gonna <end>
gonna basically be whatever is our our on <end>
we're gonna say start <end>
we're just gonna create this maybe but now we're gonna say notification i call this n and <end>
things within here i mean it's me going to be is going to be is where it <end>
into it on update and you guys you <end>
client so we're going to do is we're going to do is we're going to do we're going to use more thoroughly as
underscore name and then we're going to hit plus <end>
hover over a <end>
cursor so what we're gonna do is <end>
they're just so cool so then we hit dot and flag fullscreen flag <end>
and then we're going to add called <end>
for the most part xml reader set <end>
values and then always stuff so now what we need <end>
going to say spinner one now we're working <end>
it reference our edit text get text <end>
we're pretty <end>
and it <end>
then we're just going to create a new <end>
textview that we set up which was called http stuff i believe we're just going <end>
have this file input stream and both of those are everything so now what we can set this collected string and that's the
from and you know something like that and then run our views with an error because you know this the information the view
bitmap factory decode stream or decode what is this input stream now <end>
within these methods up because <end>
is we're going to add to import our buffered activity so i'm just gonna set that up here is so we have a
gonna be our class and then what we're gonna do is <end>
that's what <end>
current temperature dot set <end>
and then we just need to say this and what we're going to scroll down to here or no <end>
you know import tab and we're gonna do is set that and <end>
our starting y so we're gonna go into our starting y so there we go now so that's what the y is going
going to do is we click that and also want and then we're also going to go back that will also get it
key so i'm sorry public we're just going to say like <end>
sure those radio buttons work and the first methods with <end>
method called on pause so this is where we're gonna kind of the same methods for the most part and hold go through
imports and you know also for this class we're going to a constructor you want this point 1 4 last point our buffer
just kind of <end>
resume so there we go now it's as we won't need an activity <end>
we have a left value we're going to say just say just like <end>
android xml hit finish and then you'll <end>
dot-com 4/1 ford / statuses for / user underscore timeline dot json so <end>
android sdk avd manager go to available packages android repository and <end>
we've used for a method that's going to get the system service <end>
what we're going to call this or what we're going to set this equal to a new class here and then we're just
going to say as well so gl gl disabled and again the gl 10 class dot gl the camera <end>
just gangsta and then actually let's go into our helper from a <end>
going to be a little <end>
just going to be your why is we have to is an overlay overlay and we're gonna say set equal to that we
we're going to just you know that's going to kind of edit text has some time and a little result <end>
get intent which will be the data or the intent so we need to set this class and we're going to hit our
to show you guys how to add that also want to add the on click method called java <end>
check you can go <end>
and the <end>
hit whatever we could give us pretty a switch where i kind of set onclicklistener in c as always so that's kind of
downloads for the other and then within our pictures and in our file <end>
to mention up the software so you again with that problem already so if we go now what we oncreate method and you
want <end>
player dots create context this and resources are dot id dot i mean our <end>
variables variable what we're going to change this statement and then we're <end>
first for the context of this <end>
and then space and then space and say a row that it's <end>
change this bracket so let's check that <end>
we're just gonna say gl object gl disabled clients save the gl 10 object that gl enable and we're just gonna say gl
hover over it on create method so right it's not going to set it's <end>
within spur a meters and we're going to say start activity and we're going to set this equal to again just a colon
eclipse i downloaded because this we're gonna go to this new one here i have <end>
class so once we are good to resume it because <end>
here so i'm not going to be a kind of <end>
going to do for this tutorial guys would be like we actually get <end>
we're going to go on our first thing that we're going to go over to our xml file input so we have edit
and <end>
and we set so we're <end>
we use the default or it <end>
and directory pictures and write over here <end>
sleep so what we're going to oncreate method so we're just going to use the shared preferences <end>
dress like this address list so we're gonna say get <end>
gonna go to it <end>
test let's just get something like that and import bitmap i mean where this we're gonna say - get the application so we're
and paste that and in some of those classes real time instead of that got all the type of <end>
class and we're just going to work with velocities on click method and paste our splash class up and there we go back
we're going to say our our resources we're going to just kind of the take picture i know the content view to those
we're going to do what's ever within here for actual tab next maybe one of the start activity we're going to do what's
but fine when we just need to do is set up in last random onclicklistener before so it's pretty <end>
get <end>
the http get command and we're just going to say get and this is equal <end>
going to use <end>
going to help us manage <end>
voice and then we also want to scroll down below and as well so drawer because once sorry our linear layout so what
need to paint on this we're gonna do this just public pretty just set up our previous previous time we need to import
our address list so now what we kind of exception we're gonna get the dress <end>
then we're also gonna create a new class called as you can just hover over that again we also have a <end>
catch and that's just print stacktrace can you guys don't really need to <end>
which was called tabs dot this so what we're going to do it might as for the most part so we're going to
right here <end>
then just how we get <end>
gonna call this notification manager never only say <end>
we're just going to hit a static final what we do is we're gonna do is we're going to do is we're going
click that we put like that we're going to set up a reference bridge so we're going to set up a reference bridge
right here it's going to go we look like that then you just i'm just going to be vertical android id forward slash
widget underscore config configure i'm sorry and that's basically the <end>
these our final y and within our if changing y or a string so what we can just copy that x <end>
going to create <end>
available and then we're going to hit finish variable that data class name of the type new intent which will work with our
going to set this checkbox if we want <end>
tutorials ago it's gonna run our some information <end>
surface class so nothing new there and also you know this <end>
right because that's kind of test their you guys what we want <end>
and we're gonna have the sd or this cable plugged in the manifest and develop the z direction we can <end>
forward slash details question mark id equals and then greater than sign <end>
create <end>
going to set up in and then we just created which we don't need to do is just so it's kind of beneficial
again if you guys have to reference and then it's just to review it's pretty simple we're first <end>
right here we want to do is <end>
take a picture but what alright well hopefully we can <end>
to do with that and catch as well and catch <end>
whatever let me go to the signup page here and it's <end>
follow along along but i'm just going to set the comment or in the surface view so we're going to do <end>
text view so we'll do that above our <end>
construct something from the information we have that so we just have to use <end>
and then also set up and then how we're going to go with our xml file and then we're going to <end>
our application it's just <end>
string reference to string dot set this equal to new string variable this string first so we're going to call this the context
into our first key sort and then cmd or just click that we have to hit enter and then cmd or on this
want to move this one is kind of a class so we're going to refer to this as drawable m4 marker and also
maybe a vertice buffer call this be buff gonna extends the buffer class and again a vertice buffer class and <end>
what we're gonna do is we're just gonna just our hint and then for whereas you want to play our explosion so if
that's that's basically to add some stuff to basically so <end>
release other touch the the <end>
put one of it in our emulator and i'm gonna get to be keyboard and then we have to set up <end>
reading so we're going to say result to start at <end>
find how <end>
yeah it was it on the emulator because that's kind of get into that the same password but this is just going to
gonna add this <end>
we're going to say file name and that's kind of the open class <end>
can see how we do that <end>
filter and change it to delete our intent <end>
too values to work with in this tutorial because i don't know thinking there's two buttons in this has a quick with in
then we also have to add our state as well we want to add our state as well all we can do is
again it down to <end>
going to go into eclipse and for windows you want to <end>
lastly just for a lot but just set <end>
so there we go basically kind of set <end>
we're gonna call this one tv config input and we're also going to have <end>
say as long as a request code is through array list set up the data which is a request code or if so
hopefully you guys the next tutorial will probably about that <end>
point out of the right now what we're going to add it so there we go with the next tutorial all right here
passed in so again it's going to be used so <end>
modify that entry sql get information again that's going to <end>
brackets <end>
this equal to or attributes that's gonna be the first thing that and this super method there and try so now what we're
in the next tutorial will give us all we need to do is say middle <end>
implement methods and here's all of our methods for is again we <end>
read the shared preferences class so <end>
messed me up for the most part nothing <end>
have there and then a colon and then a break statement and then we can <end>
context that we're gonna say get <end>
sure you're within this part of the activity line and then we're just <end>
here so that's what that stuff so there <end>
builder and we're gonna say url within the parentheses so basically how <end>
quickly through all we're going to set up an nid so we're just gonna say next tutorial so we're just gonna say next
start watch break and case button <end>
and we're going to say this is about six yeah <end>
to check box for the value so we're going to say list preference <end>
dot set the text or we're going to say display and i mean pretty much all <end>
to say this <end>
sure if i want <end>
uses permission and we can scroll through some of the permissions that <end>
method here and we're going <end>
we're going to hit finish this kind of a a list item and then <end>
on the view class or whatever and then once it sets to <end>
task so we're just going to call this and and then the second <end>
starting point that we're going <end>
filter and then dot and then basically your class name in <end>
go forward so the keyboard so far we're going to do is it and then we're going to say for the other stuff
going to <end>
clockwise so what pretty much it was it to <end>
click listener and add that <end>
equals and you guys so hopefully that you know <end>
list to run which is created that so you know it's the way <end>
boston travis dot starting point and then <end>
click this new method that we're going to just change this new method and then we can say <end>
creating this project here so the right now it's a new boss <end>
to define it within our on create method so we're gonna set <end>
stuff and then splash and then do is <end>
talk about that we're gonna call this doing background and we're going to set it equal to b 0 <end>
package name and it's going to do is we just set up a new string we're going to set it it's actually title
i've added yet or four items for the most part and then as you can see it's given us an error it won't
database and our database name which we called hot or not database which is just kind of that <end>
going to say save file standard stuff here i got to finish <end>
we're going to do is <end>
going to return a string we're going to set this equal to the <end>
url we're going to add to it is a question mark screen underscore <end>
graphical view we're going to go over to our xml as i know we pretty much done with the on check our xml
i was a gl surface class is we're basically going to touch screen so we're just gonna say from the beginning because again
gonna say like that it's gonna add some variables to add our variables and then we're just gonna copy this and we're gonna
com dot the new boston dot travis and that's just gonna be <end>
to each to kind of show <end>
we're also going to be our button within our entire <end>
we have to do is type key <end>
kind of now we didn't everything i got the next <end>
say public void and we're gonna say insert <end>
just say touch point or something like that than use <end>
we have everything set up <end>
do whatever is opening this if-else statement shift f4 format you can do is we're going to set up in our onclicklistener before
going to copy <end>
class can see it has a second <end>
and we're gonna call <end>
something like that class is we're just gonna say within our graphics class and then all we're gonna learn that class can see
thing we also have a resource is going to do is we're <end>
everything else that they have that you know at another array you know let's do thirty let's do thirty let's do thirty let's
one of that and that's for the next the pixels so i'm just gonna say geo <end>
that and <end>
do is say start activity and then what intent do we want <end>
going to say check or the value we're going to say hey is go below <end>
name go to create a new package name and then we're going to call this open listener so we're just a name <end>
we called url dot and again get to basically display so we're going to say get well so basically we hit gonna be
confusing you guys but basically we also set up just hit dot about us is we have to do is we're going to
it in android xml so we're going to do in the next tutorial we're going to do in this tutorial for the portrait
passed in so we're going to say got basket dot and you can say get <end>
we have to have our variables and <end>
click that we run our emulator again we have a url and what we need to do is we can also do is
let's run it goes again you guys the delete the <end>
was our variables there we go now is it some errors don't really you run so that's pretty simple browser you know how
three or something like that and refer to the xml layout here like i is have a reference type here which is our
are the xml layout that's our explosion so we're going to call this to show you guys a little bit better afterwards so
follow along and that's the information we can say creating first parameter we're going <end>
those two stuff so there it yeah they touch event and now when our you import you're gonna say mp equals and then
create a <end>
can do is we can be done with so we're gonna say here and get to the resource folder but we take our
going to be good one of those straight with it has all right here get that other classes are good um we can
left to <end>
we're basically going to say <end>
text and we're gonna say this and we're gonna say this and we're gonna say this and then we're <end>
set up our edit text in there and nothing <end>
previous tutorial so <end>
source again override implement methods and not under it's not under a <end>
something like media player mp equals media player dot create and context <end>
and that we can say on resume method and that's going to set up the language that we want to the <end>
async over and it's going to do is we set up <end>
this key reference check box it's not really good this isn't <end>
know we're going to <end>
going to be a little <end>
want it here and then what we're going to do is we want to say progress dialog the setup or set up actually
is equal to get info something like that and it's gonna be equal to new string reference and create a onclicklistener and we're
going to be equal to fill parent and android layout height can fill <end>
factory and we're just going to set our <end>
going to delete our sensor and we're going to say int for the rate so now we're going to set up our surface
within these smaller ones i spell but reference the <end>
going to set it up with with an on create method as well so i'm just <end>
we're going to set that up real quick string so you basically we can just kind of a random variable <end>
and we can also close that entry and then we're passing in the context of this tutorial <end>
the root element for the xml file this kind of gives us a starting ground <end>
going to give this action intent just like we can do something like that and hit enter and then just again we can
add another one on <end>
best fits the <end>
we create our <end>
as we this in our screen so what time / top a scoop now again is going to <end>
key store and then we have to hit space - store pass and our password was <end>
size dot <end>
canvas because that's basically the first thing i working now we need to do isn't gonna be our first few times now we
we're going to say new my bring back and then we're going to say new my bring back and then we're going to
it's called public boolean on touch event and again this takes a <end>
too much same as <end>
we're just gonna print a new line so you print a new line again just backslash <end>
these methods for the first parameter yet and just you know <end>
have set up to equal that string so again just http stuff and we're going <end>
just going to go we need to implement two classes and just kind of a on click <end>
the information from our open clasp right here i put within that other types of a radio group we're going to say test
we're going to go so what we're going to implement one have you know do i'll just kind of <end>
turn and then we're going to say return true and then semicolon <end>
select bottom and then check that <end>
started this tutorial guys how <end>
app or try and then <end>
that method and also we're going to say case and then we're going to do is we're going to do <end>
can create the shared just gonna say get data and i'll display it check out well because again above our on create method
say public object and then all we're gonna refer to <end>
text to be here and so we're going to say like something like that and the next tutorial and we have three text
saying dot put and then all <end>
there we go we just set it equal to <end>
here get any stuff now it's you implement that will allow our constructor or we're pretty pretty quickly and again i tried testing
put methods you guys to do is we're going to create this resume so app or at my criteria and also you guys
imports right click on <end>
going to do it so our <end>
class or you guys and <end>
need to set this equal to control c equals 1 1 we go basically set <end>
the stuff but as you know because over here now i'm just going to go down here is where we want to comment
can actually let's set up <end>
going to set up an if statement if our status is equal to 200 then we're going to <end>
how we do that within our on move around or for the pretty much the information from the changed event and how this
basket dot set wallpaper for intent kind of confusing we say set that we can put some <end>
that we read for you know it's going to close our file <end>
client so we're going to say new for opengl again <end>
can also say label our button is just going to say c equals again r <end>
because i kind of those are pretty <end>
delete what we want to <end>
string we're going to be a new <end>
kind of output the adt plug-in and scroll <end>
import both those and what's up our references now are confirm equals <end>
going to be activity and we're going to say extends activity just as always <end>
guys have to hit enter and it gives us and then also our key pass <end>
layout width equals fill parent and android layout height is going to <end>
run google dot decode stream and creating a location was see our jar an input stream which again is equal to the dx
works here so now what we can set up <end>
delete what we have so far and then milliseconds all this that's just refer to the first again we have <end>
called input <end>
we're going to say as it's not no arguing them in we're just going to set up which we called set city with
everything for the most part set up and so once we copy that all we're gonna <end>
boolean statement <end>
is a new adapter and as kind of want to add some like these adapter for this these paths <end>
going to give stuff so what we're going to do a door in ports and so we're just going to scroll up what
you've downloaded it so we <end>
we have <end>
link from oracle javascript which and this agreement go basically <end>
going to just say display and i mean we've used so we're going to say else and then we can say display and
the <end>
going to you know release our way clock so again just go to override methods <end>
that buffer so what we can the <end>
that and again just start up and again we just again we've <end>
to equal <end>
going to add to import and and we're gonna say extends activity and what we're doing and our variables and we're gonna say
want to do is we want to <end>
name is equal to and then dot and then basically your <end>
and <end>
we're going to say final and set that equal to <end>
have to have the same password or i'm not the same password but what if <end>
bring back comm and it's we're going to say get window and say our settings <end>
to <end>
to a new gl surface view so pretty pretty default there and that's <end>
click that x <end>
this page or it's going to do is <end>
part we're going to say string as well this for paste the x direction we want to set our text to our dot
pause unpause and we're gonna set it up to do is again you guys what i'm going to call the things that <end>
helper class is we're going to say db and we're just going to say db and we're going to hit <end>
item that's going to <end>
or actually if we click on our edit text our keyboard comes up then we do <end>
has that problem after we just gonna say <end>
say sd there and define the variable above and then we can do sd dot open file output stream right here is the
likely it's the same table <end>
happening for our thread is not one and one that so what we're gonna copy the <end>
we're going to set this switching case has the next line and then we set up an intent variable so we're going to
is kind of use the right here then here's our webview import this tutorial and all we're going to go on to the
gonna say this to byte buffer i know that object don't see <end>
now now we're going to say blue <end>
gl hint and we have to reference a target so we're gonna say <end>
what's up guys welcome to your 43rd android tutorial for the new boss <end>
layout here of what it looks like and oh layout here of what it looks like and <end>
whatever the text is going to be i wasn't going to scroll to it but okay <end>
google again and type android sdk basically the sdk has all these and type android sdk basically the sdk has all that and
easy way hopefully we have the center of our parameters or we can just kind of a quick just <end>
that we can refer to the application because it works i'm going to be <end>
image <end>
need to set up our progress dialog is basically the first thing that we got some sort haven't refer to make sure <end>
some sort so now what we know how our application called this way up to our application <end>
this to <end>
hear and see we again we can just you know mess with the music so <end>
right now when we <end>
so what we're gonna say get the value so what we're gonna do is say get width because again i think <end>
we're gonna say input stream and we're going to say i is for input <end>
you know this should be familiar with this is <end>
basically <end>
let's go over here we basically we're going to say android enabled and what we're going to say android enabled and what <end>
we're just going to say final static string and we're just going to say final static string and then we're just going to
so how we <end>
accelerometer so let's you know go into activity import that and our got <end>
save it and then we're going <end>
guys a little bit and we're gonna say motion event dot you know <end>
saving something like that statement so we're using <end>
the beginning and how we're going to do that is going to define <end>
and then we're just gonna say set stream volume and <end>
class what we want to do is we want to set up two buttons so we're just going to set this equal to
so we're working with you that set up <end>
the third <end>
basically to new and that's why i should just do is we're going to say remote view we're gonna <end>
thanks guys go <end>
pass hog which is our set onclicklistener and what we can set <end>
available for you know your look through it to be the list activity after we just set up instead of our starting point
found the center of our drawable and as a quick layout <end>
to get that progress again we have an error because you know another space degrees <end>
say finally just backslash <end>
you guys want to to new yet or three options <end>
than let's say key so what we're gonna do is we're going to set it equal to b 0 <end>
within our manifest and basically basically this is going to add two <end>
just quickly do is we're gonna copy the one that prints the new yet no okay basically this these <end>
basically <end>
to start out of this but this thread i this is where the surface <end>
latitude and for this tutorials we're going to do is create a geo point we're gonna set this equal to <end>
project tab and go to clean now kind of clean our project out a little <end>
giving us with <end>
now what we're going to say android <end>
client protocol exception input/output exception and we want <end>
then just how we just change the text play and we set up and also maybe and what what we're going to say
project and export it pretty neat we're going to go to and we're going to paste that in here so i'm gonna have
we <end>
part we're going to set this integer array i'm sorry and we've worked <end>
textview <end>
forward slash capital t then theme dot capital d so comm dot the theme to work with g capital dialogue or if <end>
hit dot window dot media is when a a just kind of want to <end>
center it as well so we're just going to say android layout gravity equals <end>
to say negative 1 / top green blue value we're going to be what we're going to say just for example 0.5 <end>
i'm just gonna say add <end>
say if we hit import and we're going to hover over here real quick touch <end>
again this code i'm just going to do is we're going to say android if we're going to do it we're going to
we're going to say <end>
view i know a quick kind of a little <end>
and then or edit it will set up you know the next tutorial make it text into like that <end>
we need to basically going to say notify and what we need to pass in a pretty pretty pretty much the problem that
going to go into our our <end>
we're just gonna add some sql code and also for your <end>
within here i created this <end>
we'll say spot-on oh no i hear a lot of british people say <end>
all right so we are going to <end>
what we're going to say our brow for our web view and <end>
toast dot set length be short and then we know we have an error because this is pulling that will be is pulling
think of something from our edit text it's going to hit the list of the oncreate method that's what we're going to do
it the new class this we're going to say widget <end>
what we're gonna do is we're gonna extends activity as always and <end>
key was or q is called lists so we're going to say values again you can't <end>
every time this button is clicked we can say use equals center <end>
just leave a comments a getting info about the widget that launched <end>
use one hit import the fridge dot right all uppercase for <end>
quotations we can type try and again it's starting <end>
part makes sense but what <end>
for us and i'm just going to say new one create we can use a the method to implement <end>
simple switching case that we're all so familiar familiar with get <end>
that we just set up <end>
equal to which is gonna add to address we refer to our address list so what we kind of exception the pixels and
say something like that then what we're going to set this equal to <end>
going to do is we're going to say sm <end>
application turn up to be two things mean it if there's more program so there you go we're gonna <end>
so basically this main one <end>
click it i'm just say <end>
defined here again we just need to do this is just going to <end>
this new boston <end>
so there we go over here it's going to be is pretty much done <end>
say like that all this <end>
class real quickly through this method again get information again the key which is kind <end>
source again override implement methods and not under it's not under a <end>
dot raw dot and then for <end>
within here but there don't even it's under a onclicklistener so we're going to comment out it's the you know a textview within
now we're just going to copy whatever we can say use equals center <end>
do the pretty much what like <end>
you know set this easy way we're going to say display <end>
and then run our emulator real quickly and forth <end>
save now it's one it for the most part you <end>
can hit this and run it over and what we draw is going to be our blue what else we need to give
com dot the new boston dot travis and this is where i'm just going to introduce you guys some of the one of
alert dialog and we're gonna say divide this tutorial is we're going to start we call this alert <end>
whatever you know read some stuff i want to do is we're going to say dot input method service so set up and
is so we're just gonna say is so we're just gonna say d set the text or something like that so that's what
another string that's going to add the home <end>
float x float y and float sensor x and sensor <end>
need to be a <end>
us so <end>
get the bottom 10 object or gl 10 object or gl 10 object or gl 10 object or gl 10 object that equal
string returned oops turned name equals and then we can <end>
can just set this equal to null and we're going to <end>
know what we're gonna do is looking for <end>
a class so we're gonna say private final context again is again we need to do is create so we're gonna say private
starting point the same name as our <end>
see i just change this back <end>
the back view so we're gonna go six some sort of those thoroughly this i have on some up that surface done with
say like a progress change it we're gonna allow <end>
right here if that's equal to true then we want to also have <end>
cool android you so we have a toggle <end>
know but what we've done but hopefully when we are go back over this this little bit methods but what what would you
going to add to it so it's going to start it over changing y is equal to <end>
going to be here get <end>
around and get rap oh wait rap contact content not rap text what am i <end>
to import that we're looking for <end>
http variable which <end>
and then the version name because you know you can upgrade or you can set up and make sure you can <end>
up <end>
array and we're going to call this text and then we just set up what we want <end>
get the location updates those things within your oncreate method here so what we're gonna say kind of the things that we aren't
for 1000 years and certain key name and again you guys have to remember <end>
we're going to set it equal to b 0 <end>
audio manager and again that's just the type of you know <end>
like that real quick config to have like that real quick locate where we're gonna <end>
we want this time we also get read and it's just how things work <end>
start and <end>
are basically everything that's going to do it it's going to hit <end>
copy that and it's gonna be the first row so what we're gonna do is we want to start then what we're gonna
is we're going to relate to our index buffer which we just gotta you know move to tell what everything set that up
resource folder but that's why i with in the view class that's okay <end>
we're going to say key underscore row id something like that we're going to use strings for all of our database again we
our skit did we are drawing we just kind of how <end>
going to our text play and all that and pass we're going to do to say v right there and eggs and then
into hit enter and hit accept all that now you know find you can doesn't really small but ok and what <end>
so what we're gonna do it to set up the new boss <end>
right here we're going to set up a reference for stopwatch application <end>
we're going to say key underscore row id something like that we want these methods to actually reference that we'll <end>
we're gonna say read data with the extra hate mail down here i <end>
for know it within there it's say again it when we need to load <end>
that's what we're going to change <end>
we can say put string and then we just set up this is kind of <end>
to do is we need to say at android and we want media or i'm and then we're going to type new <end>
set the <end>
that'd be a new activity class again it real <end>
make it go even faster because we have that onclick listeners by now under our actual class i should say set to to
within our on click pending intent you can see it takes an intent or whatever you guys a request code which is is
gangster-style that's going to go we we need to just set our cursor is we need our thing we can say this so
things there's some sort of a textview we're going to go with those <end>
going to achieve so basically we kind of <end>
we're gonna open or the pending intent intent which is so we're gonna refer to it as a title <end>
called i <end>
dot disable compass and then we're gonna say compass dot disable compass and then we're gonna say compass dot disable compass and then
kind of an array list so we're just going to say this to be 0 so now what we're good and go up
runnable so we're going to do we're just going to copy this whole class my <end>
padding in there and save as i had going to <end>
add a function called hint and and then run <end>
reference our second <end>
we're just gonna say android android name <end>
for the most part so pass in the most part copy and paste this from some stuff this is i set this up
item so we're just gonna say main dot <end>
going to copy and now what this get the shared preferences and if like that we're gonna <end>
right now we're going to go down to our switching case where we import our new <end>
have that variable so we're going to say android dot and we do on what was it already <end>
use <end>
what we're going to do the <end>
eclipse tab and on accept and now we just follow right here so basically we're also going to do is right here so
it's going to finish in a toggle button i'm just going to lay <end>
what this is what this is what this is going to add our viewport we set up our viewport we look how we
say dot type surface dot remove updates so we're going to say <end>
variable that's expression dot get everything that <end>
between activities that we defined <end>
really matter but for the most part so now what i want to do is create a new instance of saying are going
drawable object then we're gonna animate <end>
in the context of <end>
guidelines of how to import these and then we're going <end>
if that <end>
refer to the source override that on it so i just get that again you know set up with our sliding drawer called
just kind of clean up your code and what we have edit text and then we're just going to pretty much done is
we run our application i'll show you guys to be to it we don't want this class so that's what we're gonna pass
hot or not so we can set this equal to be and say hot or not gonna set up a new hot or
the layout that we refer to that and we're gonna say set text <end>
really updating back to our <end>
now what we can kind of <end>
reference so we're gonna say new edit text view just like a string reference that we're going to be a string reference and
style so what we're going to <end>
sycamore to our <end>
paint dot text paint to work so that's that's what that's that's going to say dot put <end>
also gonna refer to it for the for your alias and again just the initial stuff well we're just <end>
buttons so we're going to say the most part so we're going to say if the case is our dot id dot toggle
part makes sense this point index array or list we're going to relate to our gl triangle class we're just gonna say <end>
that's what it's going to lay <end>
hopefully you guys go we've done and you know we want to make activity that we set up an request code <end>
want to center but fine <end>
alright this is getting annoying stop it my phone was sitting on the <end>
now the only case we can set up which is gonna be boolean so we're going to set up a thread now then
guys don't want to have all nevermind we're just gonna right now it's kind of close together <end>
method which we just change this back <end>
for our collected string and both of our data result above our try and we're going to create a new string and within
we want to do is say you guys should have a checkbox starting point really same one is this is set it to
define what this is running variable is we're gonna <end>
pretty small so that's what it's going to do is it's kind of <end>
it's going to be activity and we're <end>
latitude and for my longitude i'm just gonna type in something like that in our location which again that's gonna type in something
you guys in the next tutorial probably do is we're going to call <end>
tutorial make tutorials i should say oh you guys we go into our camera is what we has that person does <end>
well but for the most part and after we don't have kind of close right here and because the next tutorial we're just
travis's and now let's go back menu preferences change your list to <end>
our keyboard in here i mean it's just getting the so <end>
you guys in <end>
and we're just going to copy and we're just going to say this <end>
class called last <end>
text over to it to do it for this tutorial or something like that method <end>
for byte and buff something like that and then times it you know as well so zero four one and then <end>
as well so zero four one and then what we're gonna open our short and then we just need to open our short
again because is going to be our configure activity so there we go we need to make sure it out make it back
we're gonna fill rate of our constructor you know she's nine i didn't want to catch and <end>
some <end>
is we're going to set this equal to open file input this <end>
what this on create method right here that this application and after it that you know you go over to start with on
process and access some of that information but that's pretty much <end>
views that's not let's add that you guys simple spinner item is just going to do is basically it's a let's go down
then what we're going to call this method we're looking to this would we don't work out as you can see i pulled
because it's going to set up what we want to do is just say create method for table alias which is you guys
called it reference in each of this oncreate and now we set up two cases because we created a toggle button was it
okay i don't know how to it so we're going to set up and then we can read through the pretty quickly so
point or it's kind <end>
gonna go <end>
that sm <end>
filter is the white background and we want to make <end>
activity so this is our zero and implement like this we're going to still our sensor so we're going to still have all
two and so we're gonna just say set to zero we can also do is basically set the city set up an idea
it's going <end>
random object called our set this equal the new random and then we're all <end>
give that <end>
hit our switching case within with in with in <end>
documents and find this high density menu hit our project here to my path that's going <end>
is we're going to say dot set length times that we get the <end>
so we're going to again our cursor so we're just gonna you know we're going to use just gonna say <end>
set the cursor we're going to delete that we're going <end>
it is and then just give it and again you can set that <end>
first set up our location <end>
part makes sense but what we're gonna do is we're going to relate to our short and in the y direction and we're
should guys open <end>
the results and this class and it's been a while <end>
going to create a string and we're going to call this this method again get kind <end>
so let's define it here and we'll have there again we <end>
will equal to your mom which we set up a group or in our option three in one button is going to <end>
it and again we're just going to <end>
within our widget configuration or an activity <end>
code and it already has <end>
get data and then we're also going to get everything works again a good stuff as you can see <end>
we're just going to set up a new intent i equals new intent and then <end>
gonna say int max comm dot <end>
we're going to do is we need to do is we're going to create some take a key store or key store and
explosion and this before we don't want to do is we want <end>
display and it has the reference for our <end>
maybe like plus our sensor x and then what we're gonna do for our you <end>
we just set up our dot <end>
it's going to kind of set up that again it's going to say run <end>
that's about the android layout left oops our views now let's check <end>
lastly oops we're going to say like <end>
class what we want because we need to say you know cori we've know just need this cv update for <end>
30 minutes and all <end>
then this tutorial but we're <end>
we're going to say as we can <end>
this on class as you can see there's also want to set up what we can refer to our database has that by
now we're looking like that good stuff so we set up <end>
array ford slash values or something like <end>
so basically be let's say just canvas so you can hit the <end>
center as well and pasted within this code as a a little bit so that's why i said if the new boss in
within a method bacon and eggs but <end>
add one text and then just make sure <end>
data and that's going to <end>
going to be of <end>
resume method here that we created and then we're gonna say compass our compass the location <end>
that we check <end>
we're just gonna print a new line again just backslash <end>
with indexes so what we're gonna do is we're going to use our triangle so that's good and you know getting kind of
right here that's kind of look how much the most part <end>
type of exception we're going to define our starting new thread manager that's equal to the only other problems pretty standard into our
within our sliding drawer and that's how to run for the next tutorial i'm gonna save it out because we do is have
going to be working with so what we did this is where we want to do is open now what we're going to
and what <end>
paint variable so for <end>
but basically before we do that i want you guys go to is a basic setup for <end>
and say is called bar and that's going to set this equal to new content values and then we just have <end>
little bit longer by just adding a thread sleep method to like 1,000 or <end>
those file called cool menu trying to go over we created that you know that you know that you but so you know
other activity so what alright do is <end>
stuff within that folder so how we do that is we just say path dot m'kay <end>
android layout width and we're going to set that equal to fill parent <end>
java for the moment but basically we set up an integer variable that's equal to point 1 or reference that air as well
refer to that that email activity because this holds configuration which <end>
basically we're going to have that <end>
obviously but we'll get to the first thing <end>
button will change your ad view down here and a textview or like they're going to look like i always <end>
can see them both here this equal to one in our main linear layout that now the <end>
setting it up to find that way that and if we can use some of the ending <end>
export signed application now we're just going to hit next and then we can go to some code - - go to our
matter we're going to do is basically i'm gonna click on the same password but so we're going to build <end>
guys how that looks pretty good let's actually that's why i'm going to be checked true or last edit text you guys want
based off like i kind of introduction to our address list so we're just going to say display is an all that we're
to go right here sorry for <end>
activity class but it's some items within here but it's some items within here but again a new <end>
that's pretty small but there's one last one <end>
locate where we should say <end>
and not worry about that so how we do that now that we've enabled it is <end>
comma and well and what <end>
the sensor event listener we're <end>
also going to implement runnable and i'll kind of <end>
going to set that equal to within parenthesis textview and find view by <end>
than one button so <end>
say this out and we're gonna set this stuff so what we're going to do is set our zoom with our controller so
dot set the http get method with the basic setup basically with the basic setup basically we're going to say <end>
we're going to use our <end>
by right-clicking within the brackets going to select our class implement the basic <end>
to one will set this up just like every other time at plus id forward slash and <end>
and put methods and there we go we can scroll over here so again we're passing in our database so if we get
constructor that's a bitmap as right here so right here so let's check that we're going to define it down here so it's
within our while file input and our computer you can also do is add to do is i did in the most part
this string that we put in so <end>
put one of it on that onclick listener so we're just going to be keyboard and scroll down here we can be keyboard
obviously since this is an int but let's just <end>
float and it's going to <end>
called touched point so <end>
alignment to the most part nothing to the most part if <end>
put extra app or just the white of these smaller ones and then dot and then <end>
for the next thing we just use a on <end>
some data that will probably just set up our if that we can set it equal to our string we're going to <end>
going to just set up basically our array called array called array called array which is our delete this up here our array
just need to decode this on create we're going to decode stream or decode what is it within the oncreate method so it's
we're just gonna kind of a java just going to define <end>
you can have to type in quotations we also say our dot id dot <end>
set <end>
dot decode oops our intent and that's what we <end>
problem comes or the difficult part of the jdk is setting it up now i <end>
set up in more variables <end>
floats here we're just gonna extends the y <end>
again is <end>
webview here find view by id and then we're just gonna say our dot id dot <end>
going to be set up the information from the bitmap variable <end>
transparency is what the four <end>
to do too much done and then hit dot <end>
so keep saying it still what this tutorial is set our value is set up our slider class set up our slider class
going to you know we <end>
the bottom as <end>
you guys to that and then just playing <end>
this this cv update dot and we're going to call del row but actually since this value of that by going <end>
it a random and so how it was called our set this equal the new random and then we're all <end>
audio manager dot stream music and again that's just the type of you know mess around on seek bar is is going to
within our custom class which we created called insert pinpoint and we're <end>
we're just going to refer to our database and <end>
and then we're just gonna say toast t is equal <end>
classes is basically the <end>
milliseconds here and here's is not going to be better but it's done and it's gonna hit break with <end>
a vibrate permission again you can just type this out or just go to <end>
we're just gonna say p index dot length times that by four so we're going to native order and this our point byte
equal to 200 if we set up <end>
within it for these tutorials we are actually we're just gonna be pretty easy to tell what i thought we set up some
to so we're just gonna say for and i which we're <end>
we're gonna refer to this is the buffer we don't want it to affect affect affect affect affect affect affect affect affect affect
what you can find <end>
like as we run the program or run the program or run the program or run the program or run the program or
be useful we're also gonna create one new folder and we're gonna call this <end>
is we're going to again semicolon and we're just gonna add one to each <end>
length and which i want to disable again and just again gl disabled clients save because anytime we <end>
for a <end>
that in this xml here and all that we're going to add and all that looks looks pretty much it let's just you
point and then we're also going to create <end>
of stream volume to stream volume to zero is going to say seekbar which is <end>
story will reset this if-else statement hopefully that we can also do anything so it's going to go crazy for our <end>
show you guys can be done with this kind of a quick within our on create method be the most part and then
as we can choose <end>
again if you guys remember and how the package <end>
we're going to hit this set up a text voice it forgot i know have our <end>
within our manifest and just waste your application i'm sorry project that's xml widget stuff and <end>
going to set this equal to get in case <end>
client protocol exception input/output exception and a <end>
we're saving it externally and publicly and get the future guys learn about the person know our path once it <end>
activity so this is going to extend base or we can <end>
whatever i'm sorry and the key reference as you guys want to add <end>
short and then what we're gonna do is we need to basically be our native order and this is equal to our short
then you have basically start <end>
say our tab host then we just say add tab and it takes <end>
like that height to change that equal to beer at content and maybe android height that height and then ad unit id so
let's set that up just we want to event so <end>
just set up just set up just set up just basically we've learned about it will set it up to <end>
but you know whatever language there we <end>
going on what we're going to go over it actually actually from our canvas so we're just gonna copy this constructor we're <end>
dot set gravity and then we're gonna say dot set gravity and then we're going to use we're just going to again we
know everything i'll see <end>
do the pretty much what it's <end>
and the heck is he talking about you guys might like so specs is all the weather xml parsing within the first activity
what we're going to do is go now it's going to click that and yeah we're just going to set our onclicklistener nothing
we're gonna say like a point two five f for the new boss and we've got to say the talk about that right
watching guys hopefully it doesn't exactly how it loads our on resume method and those are the again we did probably isn't sure
because we're just gonna be <end>
we're going to set up http response we're going to <end>
makes some sense again you know this last tweet method takes some sort of some sort so now what we want to add
implement the select or the methods is two buttons called <end>
the first thing i know just basically that's just like that equal to our <end>
catch exceptions for file that execute as well so right so what this means it's pretty standard in java and we get or
tutorials ago it's gonna say within right within our on so what we're gonna do is we need to add our our in
layouts and we called that we're looking through our json object so for the most part it's going to set up we're just
parent i just going to say exit so we can see what this pretty simple <end>
sit onclicklistener real quick again this class is going to implement <end>
width divided by two <end>
and again <end>
clicking file new other and then android xml file you guys should be basically our http example what is all lowercase type of
we're gonna open our triangle class and as <end>
pause here i just got that <end>
you know our state where we can read and write and can w equals false here <end>
guys also set that text what you guys forget within there just run <end>
canvas because again the canvas takes up some information as whatever you know how <end>
to say this toggle button password we're going to set that equal to <end>
gonna say new type of the shared preferences and then we're just gonna say new input source and then all we're gonna do
mac so there as you can go to other you know a little activity so <end>
we're going to say create and we just say create source is a string array within our way but you guys you guys
just going to be underscore id and paste we want to be underscore id and paste and what we're gonna do here is
now we <end>
do and then we're going to also say our brow and then we're also going to <end>
say dot set buttons dot <end>
follow along for the release basically <end>
also going to implement we're gonna implement the sense something like this and import of the <end>
to copy and paste that <end>
those two methods for you guys a on <end>
and then run it <end>
sometimes that real quickly so easy here so we are doing we now we do that is we want <end>
we can choose from our stop button what we want to set this equal to <end>
gonna say dot t dot show so we're gonna display our toast and we're getting <end>
we're going to say <end>
the y value as well so we're gonna say - test dot get the y value as well so we copy the y
to actually use our file input stream and then we need <end>
like a toast or refer to your main context we're just <end>
we can just add an intent i <end>
app widget <end>
or we're going to say new view that we just set up here just going to call this and the method it's where
can have within our as for our input type we're going to use the one <end>
just going to <end>
we can do is we just say path is the zero of <end>
guys want to check <end>
item one and we created or before and now what we're gonna do is we're going to say is our data which is
just to be <end>
what service and <end>
what we're going to refer to our dialog class so just say is we're going to say style horizontal finish that <end>
y direction as same again the first float and top point 1 4 last point it was negative 1 in the x direction
what we need to go on to the manifest and for we're going to go on to the manifest and give us the
that'd be item and the parameters or we go we've done quite a little bit <end>
then i know you guys how <end>
clear right here so we're going to set our classes so just say unique id so we're going to add that pending intent
based off the pixels and catch so we set up a string <end>
same one so our camera application we're going to run a project and then you guys to run a project here and then
we're going to say button and then we're going to call this go we're going to do is within our view dot id
to say set this equal to a new json array passing in <end>
a <end>
to after we really need to still gonna save everything is create a new and paste it so basically if everything is do
referring to some stuff and as you know that we set the parameters the selection and all <end>
we put in there and what we've <end>
going to give us some of these <end>
activity it's under a regular activity we have two that's going to kind of a method called on options <end>
package name and this class and each information it's not comm dot you and then we run our splash class so we're going
reference is probably different choices that we want you guys that we can just kind of similar <end>
going to be a also a method again it's going to subtract so <end>
say text to our xml layout and then in pasted within <end>
going to add the got some of <end>
on <end>
also going to import that and also what we're going to <end>
and we're going to scroll down for on activity result <end>
and we can say dot and as well or you can say flippy and we can called and paste another text view text
anything we have a <end>
listener where i do all we're going to do is we set it to the <end>
statement with a semicolon and i'm just gonna hit return so you can see it <end>
other android xml file and we're going to say widget an output is and we're going to call this photo all lowercase <end>
the size we're just going to hit enter a constructor for a rate we can do is we can do is we can
api so we're just gonna get us a certificate if you guys get lost you can kind of show you guys how to
break to it for the new boston and what we're going different methods with this try to be the text or pending menu
it takes within our oncreate method so we're gonna say we can refer <end>
what's gonna happen is when they touch the xml layout we're going to go over and then we're also going to press to
show you guys that we can use some intense to start up some <end>
we're going to <end>
database again that again the emulator because i want and i'm going to go into <end>
forward slash text in quotations <end>
to relate these points to our touch <end>
interrupted air one last <end>
we're going to delete the entry according to which row we want <end>
import that and here's the also have <end>
none of those tutorials getting kind of set up a rectangle which we basically what i'm sorry space and it's going to be
just some sort that's a buffered stuff like <end>
and so once we have our on create bracket and the motion of the methods that we're going to click that <end>
create a new json array passing in <end>
return so again we're just going to add to set up an if the problem that set <end>
above her class so import that as a reference that and again under replacing pinpoints comment we're just going to do is we're
i've set up an xml layout i <end>
we're going to achieve a list within our oncreate and let's get any time that's probably event happens so what we're going to
point so we're gonna work with it a geo point so we can just say geo look for controller quickly you give it
switching case in our on activity we're going to say camera data is what we're going to call <end>
go back to native order again do like it for our textures relating <end>
somewhere over looks like germany or <end>
somewhere i think about this is the way up always yep snip-snip clip that made in the <end>
graphical view we're going to do is two again it's going to look how that looks pretty good let's set <end>
going to go into our starting point we're going to just again a you can see the methods that we're going to <end>
show you guys a on the new boston - called on the surface of a main tab here and it's not it's not
the back volume a lot time we <end>
that's never going to change it's always going to be that on click method we need to do it went sure it don't
we want to do is we hear <end>
parameters we're going to <end>
out you cry well that's about about what we've learned about you guys want just as hello travis <end>
just for application run <end>
call this our table or actually <end>
open basically what we want to do is we're gonna say entry and then we're passing in the context of this this catch
awesome but again our menu class just down <end>
to a new gl surface view and we're just gonna say view flipper so now we can say our view so we're just
guys to run our application i'm going to type what these code and our key tool - list - alias android debug key
and so that's for sql view which is going to call this one and we're just going to be a string array we're
do is we <end>
r dot layout dot and then we have all these choices that we set up this variable so i'm not too new for
to be clickable because what we're going to say android enabled and we're going to like i paste it where this is how
to be that and then we just need to do is basically when we can use <end>
gonna say our gl ten object within our we're going to do is we're going to do is we're going to define <end>
gonna say gl triangle dx i'm gonna set our try within our <end>
we're going <end>
going to <end>
let's do <end>
within parentheses again the fifth <end>
your action name be of <end>
happens just to <end>
plus it's going to be vertical orientation again nothing new i love <end>
reference so that's what we're copying copying we're gonna hit a basically this class so we're gonna say string reference so we're gonna
we're just going to say like education copyright you through this one by just going to leave it off because we you guys
we're going to do is say input type dot type class text again and you're <end>
to add some sure it man what are <end>
activity that <end>
define one edit <end>
activity for the other thing we need to import that for the tutorials <end>
dot values and <end>
we're going to say overlay type of list and then we're going to <end>
can't actually access it the way to block of our external data java just want to build a stuff for the <end>
sure our case two and our file now what this <end>
going to say data and again what we're going to say textview was item and then so now what we're returning and then
it's going to say which is have some choices that looks as you know that's <end>
guys should get into within the android tutorial for the most part then just gonna actually going to introduce you guys and then
you know and what you typed the video <end>
kind of walk you a game i can add a walk you since i'm going to click that we just hit scroll down
then we you know the <end>

return null and we can all set up like a toast or something toast at make <end>
set up a toggle button is kind of relate to the context which is the new boston the basic setup on create method
now now we set up so what we're going to do now is just copy or cut and <end>
this application right <end>
need to do is set up our surface and then we have one <end>
for class id r dot raw dot explosion and then we're just going to do mp dot <end>
relative layout is going to put <end>
we're going to paste that we're going to <end>
guys how <end>
new tab host kind of define what we can say set text play <end>
gonna touch event of our overlay to e dot get projections or touch event of our overlay to and then we also have
for the information of this because this tutorial i don't learn anything so now that there we use the results and we're just
so there <end>
it if you guys go back menu se here with actual <end>
right-click you know right click in that other android <end>
table override methods which is equal to refer to show you override or i'm sorry i go that's probably map <end>
let or you leave it within our scroll view here now so we're going to add the fill parent and android layout height
we're going to say our l equals can write so we're just going to say <end>
that equal to be 0 the gl ten class dot gl again gl object or gl <end>
going to be a on create method like that variable instead of this implement methods on <end>
zero because again we <end>
you guys <end>
let's just get into it so let's do is we can say get width for our screen so what we worked <end>
all we're gonna do it will get <end>
two and so we're gonna just set up a switching case for that so we refer <end>
like that we're working with our animation because this is just going to <end>
if expression mark or exclamation mark can't i'm sorry x exclamation <end>
eclipse tab and the preferences is right here so you click that and we hit scroll down here with <end>
a browser check things it's on it we're going to go youtube - <end>
and we're just going to <end>
we've used this e and it's under a request code in our data class so we're going to pass in the phone has
errors in the next tutorial because i'm go below or what we <end>
a <end>
going to set this equal <end>
so i mean it's done in the wait <end>
say cv content long <end>
let's set that up just cursor c equals give it <end>
to our button start and stop and what <end>
class hits button because again by just right here it's probably the emulator but where this sliding drawer and catch you guys we
our starting y is not <end>
giving us an error because we have this file <end>
keyboard after it works turn the buttons and there should <end>
want it here again we just created so we're going to say new input maybe leave a new http variable which again shut
tutorial what we set up right here to code xml or the xml layout here is i want to highlight <end>
