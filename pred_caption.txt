going to hit our internal data and we're going to call this name for a context again just save method so again wegot to make it coming up this and a <end>something like that <end>ideas the exact same id so we have a linear layout which we also have a sliding or the actual xml and basicallywe're going to say view flipper we're going to call it flippy and <end>that's just for red green blue we're gonna say one negative one in the y or in our starting point zero and we'resay editor dot commit and our edit text so now we're just saving the data so hopefully that <end>we're gonna call it within <end>we're going to say dang i don't know i kind of i'm hungry now we can put our <end>basically it's called e now we're going to try to catch and for this tutorial we're just print stacktrace because that's the lastthat and this is going to be equal to our test or we refer to the string <end>system contact dot <end>gonna say something and that's <end>we're gonna call it we're gonna set to <end>me travis and over here <end>start back and we're just question for the most part again with me travis and we're just available yet make sure everything workscan't find so what this hit finish and over and over to this to <end>want to save it opens it gives us this code and as you can see it and then android will work with ourthis equal to again our buffer reader so now what we're going to do with a string and that's going to add thisthe user of our application is <end>how to do in this tutorial is is important and so i'm <end>value of our <end>the type again that's fine we have a sensor manager class and i moved <end>ball so i <end>straight oops spell keyboard wrong and we need to change this to like camera application now is something like that if you guysthat we're going to do is we're going to open that <end>delete button and there and again a radio group and that that is a few times there and again this is again it'sthat that's why we set <end>whatever we can have everything set this equal again also we be able to kind of beneficial if not equal to basically westring and <end>right there so we're <end>probably gonna go over everything set up a capital e hit next few tutorials probably went to point class called update handler orgoing to say i call this for the class and again refer the recognizer intent and we're going <end>the file all right here we switch over here is we call this <end>but basically basically create a new class which will catch exception what we need to call this p.m. for a new variable whichfor the most part is so there we go to the xml stuff so <end>have to locate 24 bytes within our buffer instead of same constructor is we're using and b 1 this point we're using andwant to context dot start and i'll catch you guys but i'll catch you <end>or we're gonna put this variable that then i completely parameters right here and within the brackets our <end>store and in space and in our path so <end>now what we need to request code but just make sure you guys how to allow us to show you guys will setwith our our handle <end>we're gonna say this for the request code we're gonna say zero for the <end>that we're going to refer to <end>public void as we can write to again this is going to do is we're going to call this catch and it's notmethod <end>defined so we're gonna reference that you giving some sort of handler but we referred to new you know our reader to lookthis is a string then we're just <end>or whatever year guys's password was and then our key pass was also travis <end>to start is put in there you <end>just gonna say if text-to-speech is not equal to null we're gonna kill <end>be boolean so we're gonna set up a little variable that <end>we're going to say text view and then we say our spec something like that and then dot this so we're just goingwe're gonna say import play and and as that's why i kind of the brackets now <end>so you called bacon and what this if statement our based off <end>dress dot get and we're gonna get the location which we set as zero and <end>entity and then we probably <end>going to call this on upgrade we're just allowing people our <end>say as well so we say pass properly display with this because <end>within its parameters first one is <end>information of are whoops data collected variable which <end>that but it's gonna be able to this is gl load the triangle so just to to see now <end>going to copy this <end>our class name so triangle e^x and this isn't gonna have any parameters <end>answer or something like that <end>is just say on my bring back and we're going to say <end>is fine and what it's going to be whatever we want to do that in <end>just gonna create method we're gonna create method of the second one let's do the second button and again we're going to callequal to new remote views and then we refer to a context again <end>but we click that it's <end>we're just gonna call this color buff and then what we're gonna scroll this point <end>turn and then down below we can say blow up dot inflate which is <end>release of the system so again we're going to do is kind of <end>there and give us or oncreate method as you can see it's sent what <end>the user of our widget that called a class and then the class that called a theme is going <end>there and as well and then we have a resource folder and the type so we're gonna go into your project and here'sthen we set that one so take a one it's a pretty much of xml hit upload pretty much fine we go wesomething like that we give it and within our set uri and <end>xml and we're gonna do our leave <end>actually do is we're gonna see our point byte <end>do anything and just add it up and then we're going to go to do is just say show <end>object called jason and there we go we have a string builder so we're going to set this equal to in our ownpoint and within the parameters that we're gonna set this equal to new <end>we're going to do what's ever within here and also case our id dot <end>right there and again is there's also just to watch real quickly exactly which will <end>and we're going to browse and then we need to select this so again you guys want to type it out it's notthere but <end>well it's not <end>new class so we're gonna say database and you <end>within the super method we are in the methods and let's test it out see it there we want to show you guysrefer to the listener what we're gonna call instead of the <end>bossin or first <end>tutorial we <end>something like that we want to just set our webview called and you know you might just want to an xml reader andwe're gonna call this our view and what this as well just show you want to <end>paste it and basically the first thing i will say android padding to et for a scroll view which will be text tomethods and then be <end>we're going to say pass <end>going to do graphics aren't going to call this <end>and then we can do is <end>a simple simple stopwatch application so fine view by id <end>key store so <end>edit text and there we go <end>need to paint it's not that we're gonna start painting on our background because we're gonna say walk canvas <end>able to want a new activity and we're going to use some additional methods for folder for the most part so we're goingwhich i did in and just change the switch over some stuff within our <end>takes about us <end>going to wrap the label the command shift f and that's kind of give it <end>position wrong <end>string so we're going to say tab spec and we're going to call this the we're just going to say our our specthat string variable so it's pretty simple again we get our array adapter and we're gonna <end>so it's good review for our set <end>gonna update our hot or <end>say something like this textview <end>and all that stuff so that's pretty much how <end>quotations we put our action name and type overlay to our action name and type overlay to our action name and we importgive us sorry its gl disabled build a gl ten dot get familiar with some of <end>you've downloaded it if you guys know our brackets there it's always because i created now it's just going to set that upcalled touched point so it's going to say if address dot size so what we're gonna do is we're gonna refer to thefrom google maps and as well so we need to select api level of some resources that we are getting what's the wholeconnected to our pointless widget and we're gonna add this to some space to work with the android <end>and then we're just going to finish that list as well we're gonna be equal to <end>url and that's s again those are things using an exception we can just do is we're gonna use our string <end>box right there and then that's the <end>this <end>strings like that and it's gonna click that and then save we're gonna click on click and then <end>well and all of our application and then <end>and this is probably you know set up all this up guys that you know this <end>clear well we can also we need to open <end>that holds the location so now what <end>row then we need to kind of disable the listview to book two <end>intent which is going to go into the last time that i go into the last tutorial where you see all we havesay dot append and what we're gonna say this is just a return so we're <end>select that one and hit equals and then we also need an id for the code for the options here for you <end>we're gonna say our thread and then dot start and that's pretty much it for <end>is we're just gonna call this v4 like <end>we have to and we're gonna say string or object and again <end>we need to set up just like this open class and then our action name so we're going to do is <end>into that if they have to be <end>all nevermind we're <end>and you guys to pull that but like i mean after our application because you guys <end>instead of <end>it's gravity to if it's kind of clean out <end>allowed or not equal <end>available to <end>android will set this <end>actually walk you know our you know this one again when we basically add <end>there's one here which we gave the reference like this is our our xml so equal to the density pixels that's going towe're going to call this add unimplemented methods there and there we go <end>tv sql drawer class and basically the most part so yeah and all this first something like that into our text view sosomething android developed for the most <end>so what we basically we're setting they're going to refer to our text that's a good stuff within the code <end>to say toast dot set text <end>going to refer to our layout gravity and need to do or there's just how to do is set up a reference realwhatever start dot get <end>like when we <end>defined this bitmap we're also going to call <end>internet data and this is going to throw an exception so now that we have <end>well for the most part i just have to access that set <end>we're gonna set up those values of our class don't have a on create method called show you guys simple methods so howbe private mode says <end>everything else just say dot show and <end>are <end>say is within the java class and we're gonna create a which we call this display so we're gonna create a which weextra underscore prompt and then the import the import activity result on activity result but the device underscore result that for basically whatthis line but make sure that the refer to our <end>called set content view we're going to resource <end>called public boolean on touch event and again this takes a <end>reading so we're going to say result is equal to basically result as well <end>what we're going to say our parentheses and then milliseconds argument the sound stuff so what we're going to say is basically <end>the sensor event listener we're <end>i'm just <end>the actual activity again is <end>draw and we're gonna do is we're gonna call <end>a for the textview under <end>when we move this try and everything works with let's try and then save <end>right there and two buttons and add give it to be verbatim this button <end>and they were just gonna change all these fronts to back and we're gonna <end>back into that we're going <end>right here click on our application and <end>strings like string <end>going to define it within our on create method <end>to work <end>we're also going to call this and we're going to call this touch method that reference <end>about it a little bit more thoroughly instead of <end>so we're going to actually we do we don't aren't saving that <end>again this kind of review but we're just going to say public <end>triangle again for the distance over here <end>eclipse is just going to integrate the sdk as well and if you guys want you're welcome to use with a lot easierfirst <end>guys will make sure we no no it's going to check out our <end>along for our package name but we're just going to call this google maps <end>dot let's set it to <end>public <end>read our <end>that's what we need to add our two permissions just the xml thing that looks as well from the last tutorial anyways sogonna walk the canvas to start out with so we're gonna say walk canvas <end>[music] again our json object so we're going to be the background but the javascript object notation so <end>implement methods so let's make sure that we <end>like camera and the start activity and i'll just as you know how to import <end>string returned oops turned name equals and then we can <end>two buttons called start and stop all right no no no we need to call <end>gonna say x dot decode resources you guys in the most part <end>second parameter basically what that result code everything there and then our request code is when that's basically what that result code isthis equal to again <end>same one called our new other one button so within our first little activity fullscreen so what we're going to set up andjust closed off our statement with a forward slash a lesson sign so <end>set up or something like a textview so but we're going to call the references that we have something it's right now let'ssorry looks pretty simple for a button and change it within our linear layout or a reference real quick so let's check itand nothing <end>text of this one to our geo coder and then we're gonna create a new touchy of the screen up a new touchylike one and it's <end>we're going to call it a new dialogue for the second which was called basically called our other thing we haven't done it'snew my what was it to new my bring back surface <end>going to be public void set city and what we're gonna add some variables to return some variables some sort haven't been ishere so we're going going to be protected void on post x cubed <end>we have to do is we're going to actually going to be our url like we want to edit text play <end>going to do is we're going to try <end>is there and <end>up here get how to be equal to our <end>something like that but that only codes out everything <end>also this item and hit ok sends that we're going to show you also you can see <end>button start and our button stop for stopwatch from xml forward pretty get you guys will get the second button and we <end>view within quotations we're going to say got basket so we're going to say got basket so say run our handle content viewthere <end>like that now we're just gonna you know an edit this string that we put in so we're going to <end>say string dot size so we're gonna say our class there's a few different ways to look like this current <end>to do is <end>variable we call that layout host <end>animation and now all i forgot the beginning and don't worry about this command click but yeah <end>we're <end>can just change this back <end>basically we're working with the select our our view which is pretty simple browser our list and what <end>tells you guys we're just you know there's no no to get default shared prefs or not it's gonna create your variable <end>and then we're going to have which <end>do is we're going to pass in our xml and then we're just going to have a pending intent just like when <end>data we're going to say we're going to say jessica alba is dot dot and <end>get latitude and we're also going to say like we're going to say like we're going to call this location location maybe likewant to have it start up a string name and we can use there's nothing right or what this would be equal tounregister it so it's not always plain so i'm just gonna go to source <end>is we're gonna have to set up this works here so <end>is equal <end>so i <end>our did set up both of our <end>just right-click new <end>call this display and again it's still see it looks so <end>this string and that's what we're gonna do is if i mean it's not going to be equal to that has <end>android layout height is going to wrap the label the button tab so we're just going to hold our program let's test <end>then it takes a bitmap that we click this so we're gonna say - bitmap <end>the gravity is currently display and we're getting this pretty much easier <end>so our <end>allow our oncreate method <end>there we <end>say st dot close and we're <end>and button so first we click that we are yeah it's not but hopefully we have our <end>have to do is basically say we want to our gl ten dot gl underscore fastest that's <end>save it so those subjects but you guys here so we're going to say item and <end>so we're going to do is basically this is the the standard stuff so <end>our object within our class name which we should override url getting music and we're going to be our <end>based off our list and that's gonna be able to locale that's <end>filter and i'll explain what that it's kind of <end>part so we're going to say got info something like hey man toggle button as <end>is we're just gonna call this v4 like <end>instead of saying set content view we're basically going to resource <end>maybe well a drawable folder if you guys put in <end>going to be the package name that package click method and again it's gonna be of the type new intent and again it'swithin our edit text that's basically going to be like that to that to that we need to do is just right hereof gives us a string builder so we're going to add so we're looking <end>call it so we're just going <end>can just say dot i what we're gonna do is say zero and it's not <end>int and then we're gonna cast it in as an int and then we're gonna cast it in as an int because goingcurrent <end>of these <end>later as we want to do <end>can or f10 one that we need to set up <end>well i'm not even leave a comment because it's getting late and kind <end>set up our list as for loop but just say whoops i thought i'd <end>this save file two buttons confirm and <end>else just be what am <end>basically going to do is basically a return <end>gl just it's rgb a triangle something like that but we'll come <end>to say v right there and then we're just going to kind of delete it out of <end>are the animation buffer we <end>is within this statement and then again we can say if <end>we set up a try and file <end>of code android padding and as you can see you can do padding around with it out make sure we check that <end>simple switching case that we're all so familiar familiar with get <end>that bundle <end>parentheses and we're just going <end>touchy because we're just going to say <end>our cursor is too much the same or actually we need to those are <end>our new activity is where we're going to use this view and this variable within here right below our layout i mean youcalled set content view which is it value of it to do with this i haven't i'm not quite a gl up withyou guys you guys get <end>downloaded it downloaded already third-party add-ons or basically type it out of it and it out because this <end>then it's going <end>so we're going to do is <end>awesome happens but our package my my bring back over four the new boston <end>like a new class and we're going to say extends comp or overlay and then we have <end>those and when we click this our final y and our final y and our let's scroll down below our screen we're gonnaspecify that a little bit more we're gonna create a sax parser and this <end>follow along along and for this <end>and this is so we're going to call it cheese id was already overlay item and then what we're getting <end>while file input stream dot read does not and we're gonna say read data and we're gonna say read data <end>so again we set up and stuff so let's also do is need to allow us <end>yourself some time with the errors so i'm just going to do in two menu again this <end>we're going to <end>might remember class we're going to change just add a <end>something like that and it's exception we're like that that this xml reader parsed <end>value that we're reading so we're going to say is why we want to do in this example <end>call this file url if we've <end>we're going to say a drawable d and we're gonna set d which again is <end>going to do is we can use for it later so we're going to do that within our on create method we're goingthe length of our gl point zero or this <end>we're gonna say <end>once but yeah <end>well <end>and paste another textview for a text view etc we go <end>we're gonna say register listener and we're just gonna say set up so sm dot get sensor <end>with me within the <end>new http get and then we're going to refer to our url lowercase dot - <end>to be called protected or it's going to be protected void on post x cubed <end>call this p.m. for and for the most part and again we're going to <end>cool and you can see all the methods you can use for the toggle button and we're going to <end>to say <end>text of this toggle button listener so we're gonna say our button widget and it but again pretty what we also set upis called <end>so we're going <end>so it's going to quickly but we set up a new there and there we go basically the attractiveness or <end>activity or application so we need to have that i applied to be the whole application on that starting point for the mostcalled or our whole <end>say cv update dot put and again we just refer to our key name which we're <end>and we're going to call <end>our first bitmap that bitmap that we also add to our you know this is what <end>gangsters gangstas and you know text for first you guys i should say add unimplemented methods and we're returning that's we're going toand let's check this out but that's pretty good so make sure since we have worked but it's <end>button and preffer our button is pretty simple there and i'm gonna do is say ctrl et here we're going to <end>result we need to do is basically <end>and paste it and i said just going to <end>we're looking going to set up a dialog <end>oh yeah i'll catch <end>that's crazy format and then at <end>to be this on upgrade method we can set it equal to our result which again will be whatever <end>i know it's not you know she's nine that's where we have our update <end>the reference and we're going to say <end>our string that we breed we call them are too equal to read to negative one so again this doing here so nowthose towers because pretty much the index within <end>again type of like right below again we just format and it's not good just kind of <end>going to call this returned picture because once sorry our camera <end>within the manifest and for a splash class and type a theme so comm dot the to within our application bracket and overthis format below <end>this and we're going to call this ad for so <end>we're gonna pass we're just gonna call <end>but basically when we just use some of the methods and again we scroll over here and again just refer to this methodso we just have to <end>to do it won't be under this and we aren't really get into <end>player dots create context this and resources are dot and resources are dot and resources are dot and resources is our <end>this object of the object of the context so i mean where you guys want to point does is the order of thosegonna exit which is this is kind of a splash class look at least i have met so now what we're doing insteadit's kind of clean up a text in java process and text view well or you know if we have to do isdevelop the operation check everything in the next tutorial <end>within the take picture switch in case it you guys basically a good <end>layout for the next tutorial i just test on that xml layout so you know that <end>as well so <end>tutorial we're basically going to put a text we're going to add a button a hundred and that's what it's data and whatloop so we're just gonna say for <end>whenever they mean this probably going to say probably gonna say set adapter and we're just gonna say set adapter for <end>be the left then once we can do is just like our x and now time we did in <end>thing that that's kind of <end>into our layout called main was it from that layout and we have three just those guidelines properly but <end>we're gonna call this <end>our load some after everything works get our input stream so again to <end>gonna do is we're gonna say private other type of tedious here so i'll see <end>yatta print stack trace again <end>dot put extra i just for <end>kind of complex it's kind of hard to remember but that's why that's why <end>that it we use our bitmap that we did previously so we want to do is when we take our bitmap this <end>we're getting passed in and as you can see we call <end>running it's equal to true and that's kind <end>know we can pick a color from here so let's <end>xml so <end>that bridge / bridge over to the xml we're going to say button was a button again r dot id dot <end>maybe like plus our x here so we're gonna do for our you <end>all right so we're gonna say g-unit download that after our font cuz you know the top we can put in <end>again to build a capital l equals 1 something like what's going on the brackets <end>it's going to refer to the y values <end>it <end>for example of <end>travis thanks for that activity what we have our title and and then we have <end>so we're just going to say return true so we're looking for a web view and basically what we're going to say returnwe worked with arraylist but android r dot layout dot simple underscore <end>cases so we're gonna say case then we're gonna refer to the motion event <end>available to <end>and it's going to line the first activity and <end>teaching as well the video most part again we can say our id oops zero something like that <end>what we've <end>we <end>and then just make sure everything works i'm gonna have <end>awesome it's kind of pull guys we're just gonna do is we're going to click this by right-clicking like if that's <end>this isn't there and click the the last parameter we're going to be of our intent is is the extras that's kind ofor whatever year guys's password was and then our key pass was also travis <end>well most of our <end>xml ns ads equals and then we <end>programming and again i think about that's confusing or not but this time i'm sorry which is <end>refer to your emulator so it's gonna go five six some items down here and then it still gonna start stop so ourand it's going to allow us air i mean this okay button <end>again travis and again refer the recognizer intent and make sure the intent within the activity <end>maybe well and then we defined it within the pixels and then we're gonna let me of things within the extras just gonnavariable setup called so there and again if you guys <end>get the developer page here and it says l example have that great stuff because i just need to jump android developer andcalled our request code which again <end>going to you know release our way clock so again just take a little <end>we're going to say cursor our cursor that we also have anything again that's where our cursor is going to <end>false but read is going to be true and then the last state we're gonna import can read and write but <end>then this tutorial but we're <end>because if statement and then a colon and within the switch up but this where's the fridge <end>going to be the same concept we're gonna <end>click list interview to this as well so we're gonna do here we're gonna say our sound pool dot and <end>we're giving <end>want to do is coming from the xml layout of what the mac <end>the http not really not been selected our <end>so we're going to call this again is we're going to call this check state method that we're going to have some kindand our arraylist that we also need to actually this constructor again this the center of the context what that's gonna do isstring call e and this is gonna be equal to our info or edit text called info <end>as well and then we're gonna implement <end>and we're just saving just pretty simple like <end>if we go down for background what we're gonna do we aren't <end>actually let's do if changing y is less than a canvas dot get height then <end>so that we <end>for you guys enjoyed that we're gonna <end>say uses permission and again guys done <end>going to return our cursor that we set <end>release basically it's not equal back equal to our dx divided by like let's scroll up but okay so <end>so now we're going to change the text or if the toggle is set the input type here so let's check out <end>bitmap type object or whatever so basically when we well or no okay and then we're going <end>our layout which is the specific layout we basically have our layout gravity to worry about those text for our statement so wethat we're going to set it to our returned name and then <end>external state and within here so we're gonna say if state and we can't compare strings like this one it's gonna do isneed to set up our progress update bar so we're going to be it we extended the last tutorial so i'll catch youignore for the last side we don't know our gl 10 dot gl <end>this <end>put one of those straight lines and we're just gonna say orientation and <end>well and we're going to align it to a plus id <end>ball so we're gonna refer to the input <end>here whatever you guys want and all set up text scan set and this air just to <end>url we're going to find your <end>can say can whoops can go back so that's going to be like hey can we go back <end>within our <end>clicking file new other and then android xml layout and i <end>completely red green blue alpha <end>is we're gonna say as whatever you guys want to mess <end>and it's going to <end>is looking for a string variable up here so again we're <end>equals 0 1 for the most part set up and so what we're gonna draw <end>intent and we're going to set up this line here and <end>button <end>then what we're going to call this our our dot <end>right here and it's going to go now what we're going to say i'm sorry string and then close it for the mosthave the <end>here and we're gonna say our text because it's just going to <end>constructor also going to take a bitmap <end>and since we say you just like what that's gonna add to <end>what they're how much pointless <end>google maps emulator something like that we're going to select our target <end>and we're just going to set it up within there and again i mean it's just going to <end>execute whoa outside <end>between activities that <end>but still our <end>read from our class for class name a pretty clever into our class here now we just need to do now hopefully youthat's spelled wrong as well who cares stupid things permissions so i just have <end>that <end>right because you're like that and also y and then we're going to say is basically <end>this string that <end>let's define <end>going to random position so just going to say our dot next int <end>cut it i mean it's going to say file so what we're going to start with with this file output stream so nowandroid layout height is going to wrap the content the button and that'll of code and that'll center as well and <end>web webview called d true so it's not going to finish our application <end>we're gonna relate to <end>again true or drag and paste everything so we basically have our regular through but you could have our regular through here inand we're gonna call this exactly what we called you know this <end>be point 1 4 last point it was negative 1 in again is a float and this one's going to be of awe're just gonna you know that or in the y direction and we call b in there and <end>or set up entries is what we just add some information you do is we need to add <end>going to create a string and we're going to use some variables we have to have a <end>we also need to set up in and there we go <end>errors that this application hits extras <end>kind of the starting point so we're gonna <end>just going to say again sliding drawer just <end>finish i <end>a like progress dialog and it adds an int and we have to <end>which is <end>method <end>add because that's what <end>then paste it a couple variables that you <end>stream <end>because i figured there's one all the same thing that looks pretty much done with the button we're going to align it totutorial for example if we had two brackets and again it's going to set up basically <end>part makes sense this is we're going to relate to our buffer this <end>that again we're just gonna say our few tutorials maybe and as a location manager <end>paste one of all <end>or we got this is looking for this <end>for the <end>release our starting x first - which was being gonna copy the <end>let's copy and paste this exception happens we're just going to shoot down here so hopefully that we created a toggle button here'shere so we also converted <end>method for the most part nothing too new <end>refer to be pretty simple <end>press we're basically going to be our button within our data we're going to <end>want go to new class <end>part we're gonna say <end>true to true to start with until our thread is equal to true to start out with the only case that happens butand we're gonna say <end>this and this variable <end>don't room and <end>know it's those four buttons and then we will catch you <end>and let's say let's set up our button android layout width because 100 is and as our orientation because 100 is going tothen for again i'm done within this because we're gonna start everything for the x value be the y value again that's notcalled random and so there we go every time this you know we call this <end>don't even need so pretty standard so now is add a method <end>so basically all that all of the command show you <end>know put some other type of type that up so <end>that the distance over here it's under our <end>that there we go through our overlays and then <end>center it as well so we're <end>methods overlay item create item and the size so now what this first index and say on the super view so we're justread to open class <end>gonna get when an exception and then we're gonna say <end>source override implement methods <end>say like camera application now making sure it's within our package and also set up the vibrate we're just gonna say keyboard hiddenso we're going to say int for integer and camera data and we're actually going to <end>and we need so now what we need to return basically <end>the <end>the most part boat so think of those out our x value our background x or actually draw we can do for ourfrom both of this this <end>prompt and we're <end>so we're going to do that this toggle button won't getting pretty familiar with this it's just kind of a confusing and <end>it's gonna say if we want to this application a simple we're just the most of the background stuff so it kind ofwant to walk you do now is set up a lesson sign and again from least some some <end>actually do is we're gonna say we need to call this again this and we're <end>will work so there we go through <end>int so we're gonna say what's up now what we <end>shoot down to that application on basically <end>we're going to say our first thing a little bit different <end>table and then <end>this is there's also need to a title we're going to say list preference <end>so what we set content zero or let me check all our <end>stream dot read with the parameters we're gonna give it and within our file <end>gonna save this font now so it's basically going to get bigger and bigger until it gets to <end>something like our holder and there we <end>gonna call this our table or actually info we'll call it info and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna just basicallychange this variable called is ronnie it's gonna be true or <end>our unsigned short <end>to <end>and then we're going to <end>called a theme so we need to set that up by saying android theme and we need to set up <end>that we're going to say overlay type of our overlay which we called map view to our overlay which we called map viewthe settings is our bufferedreader which will get <end>boss in and what we're trying to which is <end>for the most part we're gonna say do again we're just gonna say our string in there so we're going to set equalhit two <end>within its parameters so you know for our statement <end>we're going to do what's ever get <end>just going to force close our url lowercase dot - <end>that we read it so sorry get it's going to want to <end>back into our song and to define a delete the same layout i have to import that and implement the method there wepaint dot text size so we're gonna start so our constructor we're going to say <end>we can put a text view down pretty kind of clean up so just set <end>no reason i did this and <end>string we're gonna say is called protected void on pre execute <end>to be protected void on post x cubed <end>but <end>activity the other <end>just say <end>of the same as and again <end>we're gonna paste it so we have four choose <end>interval and then what we have to do is we have to say flippy dot start <end>role i guess it's not again this so there we go and again this so there we go just a new xml evenstarted with this so for that the xml i'm sorry but just wrap the save some stuff you can see this xml it'sneed to change this one button and then we also need to put like one that i mean that within the same idspinner everything it's hey can <end>the video but i will create a context so it's basically just a couple learned on top of our drawable item that's beingdot put and then we have an extraction one last vertice array because again leave a comment something like that or just sayto our <end>triangle is clockwise so we're gonna do is we need to populate so we're just gonna say dot i is we need tocanvas for a bitmap test is just going <end>and we're going to do is we need to throw an exception that we need to throw an exception that we need toput those classes and then <end>first thing we need to use this variable that first thing we need to do is say string reference for that a classgood so we're just going to scroll up to the default and then <end>set wallpaper <end>again casting in <end>and then we're going to send data we're going to say these are in case we're on click which we just <end>because it's an color within per buffer so what we're working with a pointer that but we're it's gonna say <end>our sensor manager or sensor manager or sensor manager or sensor manager or sensor manager or sensor manager or sensor manager or sensorwe're going to say view flipper we're going to call it flippy and what <end>is go into a method which is <end>we're going to delete so we're gonna say textview to equal to be our boolean value format and lastly <end>prompt and then we need to click that and then go to it so pretty easy walkthrough <end>do is we're gonna do is we're gonna <end>as a cool menu now what we also have to <end>can't we'll finish off typing a comment <end>service and we're gonna pass in notification <end>manager and we're gonna pass in <end>people table and we're just gonna extends activity what we're going <end>and we tilt our reference of some of the of getting kind of get rid <end>click listener because it's going to call this it's all that so it's just click method because it's getting a start a clickevent and we're going to <end>we're gonna say our table name and we're <end>spinner 1 and i don't know it looks like not let's run until i comment file so i mean it's probably too muchwell basically saying are what this clear command <end>such as like action answer call if you're going to call someone for <end>new http get method and then what we're going to do is we're going to do is we're going to say our <end>like that picture we're working with this string that we put up to et here we're going to just set up so we'refor the most part and which we should get rid of the <end>as <end>that up this equal to put like equal to put up and copy this equal to put like pass we're returning a stringallowed to do that within our on create method and set up our variable so we're just going to <end>method within our class and then we say th equal to null and we're going to set up a new <end>so let's jump over to our base information with <end>set up within our you know we actually going to say our helper and it's <end>net next application or the new boston and drop <end>string variable is <end>of our sensor that's looking for the y direction which is <end>again for this license agreement for the most part and probably still all these as you won't go up to do that rowlittle you know painting to the canvas here so i'm just gonna run it make <end>little bit better think you guys saw in our screen and again as i'm just going to show you guys probably <end>know put some other type of type that up to which we're going to say put string and then this <end>can do is <end>shared string and hit paste and we're going to set this variable called data return <end>called a gl capital l example second so <end>application has that by what's <end>and again we're just saving in the context of this this class or again we're gonna say entry because it <end>there we go we can <end>that you card but let's see <end>you when we have you guys probably go <end>change this equal to like maybe 20 dp for all we're going to do it and you can <end>that's how <end>it's transparent i <end>actually have canvas and so we need to do is <end>hopefully you guys the other thing we kind of sets up <end>have that what what we're passing in state variable which is called <end>going to say spinner equals again spinner and find view by id rg <end>up and add <end>corner of <end>down to d open stream int and we're gonna say equal to b we're going to cast it as a location manager <end>because we're just going to start with and we're just going to work <end>reference so we're gonna say string and we're gonna set up an xml file output setup <end>and then add another one for our <end>dot and basically we get our onclicklistener set up let's go down here and setup <end>flag we're going <end>the reference looks and maybe <end>let's say this let's put this <end>item so we're just gonna call this overlay item so we're just gonna call this overlay item so we're just gonna call thismake sure it looks like our third button we still not <end>again we have so we're just gonna say like <end>whatever but anyways so it's all this it's all this is the map we're going to have to do in this <end>that's going to be like that view by id method gets called <end>we need to add <end>want and we're just oops i'm sorry you're a widget id and then lastly we want <end>our city we're gonna say temp underscore f and <end>those guidelines properly but yeah since we're looking for all this button but basically our home screen click for the most part soof like in our progress bar do is say our compass do is do mp dot <end>and our can read dot set text to our top so if we get a false we know <end>so it's going to do two constructors and we just set up here with so now it's going to <end>a great speech so we're just going to say text to speech so we're just going to say text to speech dot cuewe're going to pass in <end>extends activity and what extends means is that we're extending the <end>or private up here again we need to again <end>just gonna say our location l dot get longitude and again we're just leave a comment just you know how we're also ourwell or you'll see i'm sorry it's kind of hard to talk and think at the <end>thread and so once we are type not equal to true and then we can be boolean so what we're gonna draw <end>but that's new code if that i'm gonna give you guys in <end>method is that <end>method called on pause so this equal to <end>class what we want because that's what <end>for textview and another textview so again nothing <end>i just want to make sure we have everything defined before we <end>we'll get into our class it's pretty much pointless but i will catch you guys that <end>won't it for whereas you <end>pointer is the pointer that we need some easy way that we need some easy <end>up a because i was a and we're just refer to our string i'm sorry string or the system contact and then <end>super line right here so i'm sorry for that but okay there's our <end>button because android so <end>that we're gonna say our xml we referenced it in java or false so what we're gonna do is say our edit textklaus so we can easily just code that it takes an action name equals match up within your extras just called <end>get into that right now so open up your splash activity and hit enter right below our <end>within this and resources are <end>because the <end>from the values of our <end>with a frame layout which we referred to beer at plus id /m v format view main something like that now <end>starting method and again we're just gonna right click go down to our starting point class dot open method gonna open and alsojust going to return the info to call this variable name and put like that we need to say public whoa sorry i'mmost part to happen so <end>say surround with try and catch as well but i'll catch you know <end>going to be we're <end>refer to the tutorial section and we're just gonna be <end>and as well and catch you choose so just get down implement methods that <end>and you know something like that <end>that the phone has in this and basically <end>nebraska or whatever the person searched for so we're gonna have say <end>we're going to say longy is what we're going to call this again casting in <end>part but i just want to save in <end>gonna copy this our fx equal to 0 because that's <end>save that and run it <end>going to make sure everything is gonna be int so let's set up the <end>that's uh no used this text paint to fill <end>surface <end>but anyways so that's basically the <end>right here and then we're going to leave a webview here so basically that's that's going to be just like <end>make sure you guys <end>our <end>of some sort so that's going to be these columns in our entity of our entity of these three <end>allowed or not object so let's set up our compass what we're going to say <end>sp to be equal to new sound pool object and within the constructor or <end>connected to the resource as <end>the methods for google maps and this is what's <end>preferences and then we're gonna say get <end>listeners - both are save and/or <end>our file name something like that we set up this line but we call this we're saving to <end>familiar they're thinner on create method as we have to create <end>anything so <end>text tux paint which is it so for the <end>the location so what we need to do is we're going to need so instead of code class so we're gonna say weinto your c drive or workspace under <end>we're going to call this a <end>what we're going to do is set up a not something called an id we're going <end>all uppercase white like what they labeled it as a box is but there we go we implement have a bitmap that wetwo center because i know i label that we're gonna <end>up just hanging out one to the reference to the title it there for the most part so now this and paste itwe're gonna say actually <end>so think of our our thread here we're gonna say - test dot get height this time / - <end>[music] again our json object so we're just going <end>throughout our application is equal <end>second all right here so again let's quickly show you guys say add and we're going to click that the screen and againdo now let's uh check it the open it equal to this for file input stream now we just say <end>and then tts contact content not rap contact our second android if <end>before and then we work with it a new object or here and then we're going to say get system service and <end>necessarily the way that <end>setup now it's called our de id oops our dot layout dot sql view like <end>should <end>dot-com 4/1 ford / statuses for / user underscore timeline dot json so <end>going to be set up this variable that <end>hear and see we again we've set <end>the method there and we're <end>gonna set the most part so what we set type new class for the most part so yeah it as <end>developer page again because it's under this is equal to <end>that we're going to set it to our returned name and get hotness and that's what we're gonna give it and again wecall this doing work cuz you know it's pretty much handling all of our <end>do something we're going to add you <end>for a lot of lame with our xml picture because once sorry our camera <end>we're gonna do is we're going to hit enter we kind of exception <end>right and scroll <end>we're gonna pass in again we don't want <end>whatever the text is going to be i wasn't going to scroll to it but okay <end>we're going to say full <end>want to get the <end>our string that then we want to return true <end>android layout because we're just gonna say next tutorial so we're <end>button it's going to set gini <end>method of our map activity and we're gonna <end>say our drawable just the purpose of the next time this is going to finish and after we need some default <end>the input type class and hit dot type text and then variation and <end>good so we're just gonna say check and we want to make sure a request code or i'm <end>try and catch <end>within this variable that they get window and we're <end>to unplug that configuration type of give reference of readjust be like run it what we go there and add a few blocksimplement the select or the item selected listener and then you know it so <end>going to say spinner equals again spinner and find view by id rg <end>beginning so we're just gonna say dy equals dy <end>set it up that to allow it to this open listener going to return statement hopefully you know use it we need tobecause again any basic so again for the <end>to have our variables <end>in the video but just create a context so private context can't spell and we're just gonna call this <end>we're going to say string which is our action name which <end>in street view so we want to turn the street view off so we're just say <end>everything's okay if you <end>this equal to again just a new http get method and then or instance of <end>reference find view by id and then it was sliding d was id we gave our <end>activity for the most part <end>we created called menu hit stay am or i created just to get reference and then it <end>string reference and then we're going to say our our spec again is can think about that case then our spec so we'relayout width equals fill parent and android layout height is going to <end>a string that's our <end>want to <end>handler you know handling xml stuff variable <end>google again and type android sdk basically the sdk has all that <end>this for edit button and paste it within <end>well and <end>just kind of set it because we've <end>to this in the next tutorial so i'm just gonna say next tutorial so make sure that spoke correctly and we're gonna <end>equal at drawable forward slash plus selected work in this one if it's <end>key is kind of pull up for our statement and then run our our statement and then run our our whole class we'rewe're going to hit enter and we're just going to give it something with this you know our you know the delete ouryou know this instead of creating our own at android name which we set up are listed act <end>gonna say create entry and then what we're gonna <end>we're gonna say our thread which is not did so we're gonna <end>by hitting the sdk and <end>setting text play call <end>running it's equal to true and that's kind <end>you guys enjoyed that but we can read that <end>sound pool we're just gonna say sound pool and we're going to call the <end>browser our brow something like that and again we're just gonna say find <end>reid extends async tasks it's been a while i think since we have an access import provider within our file and then wedatabase and then we're looking for <end>we're returning and then we want the most part that's what we're returning our protected data protected void view f for this stringstring so we're gonna say string f i don't know and we're gonna get our <end>now it's going to shoot down to that onclick listen <end>text which we just looked at and forgot already called save file dot get <end>we're gonna do is so <end>pretty simple and to do real quickly do and a map view nothing new for the most part here but at the jobour plus image that we have everything so basically i know <end>it's just going to return basically for example <end>set up and we said we're probably going to have our variables and it's going to say public void set city and whatthat we <end>well then it we're going to call is gonna say test and if you guys all of our initial points set up nowand then we don't even working at you <end>is pretty much how that good for the on click on create a add our <end>click method called tab host and it's a text within our next so <end>webview here find view by id and then we're just gonna say our dot id dot <end>boolean's anything for the <end>have a sensor <end>we're going to add a key reference check box it's just we're going to add a key reference check box it's not reallyto be set up let's create a implement the unimplemented methods so nothing new there <end>there's a good for the most part and as if i just continue onward so i mean it's just right here and we'retwo and so we're gonna just set up a switching case for that so we refer <end>method and we're gonna need to do is set our <end>basically the text view and the method we were just created e^x we're going to do is go now and what we're goingset text and we're gonna add some stuff because you guys <end>there's references to go so again just variables to our bit more <end>say at drawable that equal to at drawable and then plus id and then finish <end>go into our starting point with the <end>going to <end>going to do actually relates to <end>that but what we're gonna get the y axis 0 the y axis 0 the y axis 0 the y axis 0 theand then dot to string again nothing new and then we're just allowing us to do is we can do this string <end>title to hekia and there we go and right here all right so we're going to set <end>class as db helper and we're gonna extends the version since we could have so we're gonna say private sql light database andgoing to go to change this to center this <end>public and we're gonna say hot or not and it's gonna take in a context i <end>toggle button and find you by id this is kind of boring because we cleverly <end>into your emulator or virtual devices we're going to give us a new layout and it's not <end>our string buffer dot to call the input-output some sort of a return so that's <end>false but <end>our final y and let's scroll up now what are scaled y is equal <end>when it by that <end>going to be equal to fill parent and android layout height can fill <end>we set up our way that to call the new boston package name and you just copy and you just need to gointent that's <end>we say set content view and then we have our resources again so then we have our resources again we can't have <end>has the most part we're gonna do <end>int and basically <end>and <end>click list interview to this is just a i mean our sound pool dot and <end>let's do with this it's gonna be called the xml and it's a button in here we're just walking through the <end>going to set up our our adapter and this should be kind of familiar with <end>all work with it a box for ball reference so you know the command so there we go create a switch <end>is called set temp again our textview to be basically the next tutorial hope you have the most part there is we're goingdelete samantha so we're just going <end>we need to go on to select the website to go into the code we're going to load up <end>parameters the text so we're going to refer to the nth so we're going to refer to our random text that we putloop so we're just gonna say for and you know something like that file for a toast and semicolon and we're gonna sayso i don't know we touch the variable called my bring back or whatever you know we touch the context of a powernormally would launch and type our <end>basically the current time and say current v and pass in <end>guys because i told you guys what i need to add another thing <end>oncreate method of the <end>from zero and then that's just a way we can do air checking so we're just <end>our whole class called this thread because we are all set up basically that's just like that holder can basically like this becausesee what we can do <end>true or <end>name dot get text and then <end>android that's the first thing we have a <end>function within our map so we're just going <end>make any other type of variable we define this <end>linear layout generally all this is just and oops i have <end>statements only going to draw if x and when you guys all especially you can see how <end>specify that a little bit don't work out a default that we're gonna pass in a little bit don't work out a stringand also do or command so <end>on our project <end>again within its directory <end>and again to maybe but let's let's copy and paste we want to do <end>context so we're just going to finish off <end>plus equals plus again and it's <end>is our second parameter is so <end>again called shared preference type variable that <end>those methods that <end>code one which i want to send google <end>thing so it's <end>what we will have this text view don't worry working with two brackets below we're going to create a <end>going to be a new sensor manager within our as <end>exactly what we want our class so but i had that looks pretty good and as you guys are trying to be wrapcanvas for a plus get when we <end>it's going to be our <end>that we <end>view so just drag and drop a new every time we're gonna add a button i mean it's a button that we readdivide it by refer to update method we're just set up divide it by one e have that and also when we're actuallyblow our gl dot gl glu and we're just gonna say dot glu glu look at <end>is we're gonna call this a wm for app widget manager and we're also gonna call this onclicklistener and we're also gonna createand grab the entire class and cut it so there we go now of those towers so i told you guys in thisput one of it won't want it as the introduction to and then <end>your mom referring to this one three pictures within the density pixels that's why we need some room here we are actually goingdate button what we're going to do is we're gonna call this just <end>stream and get how many bytes is for our save button we have to surround this with <end>everything in again you right-click on <end>i'll try fall along and just get this set up and this is great reference <end>in street view and we want is our map dot set satellite to be <end>do like a try and see you know you know this is go to be true as well so what that then whatreid extends async tasks it's been a while i think since we use this but <end>application turn it so we're gonna say our audio manager and we're gonna say this and we're just going to copy this currentgive us a left value than the center of that in the center of that float we just set up <end>we're gonna call this sy for the same concept <end>basically the resource folder right so we're just select this basically what we say <end>gonna set our kollene so we're gonna pull the working with some more in the one <end>the be set send its <end>google maps emulator something like that we're going to select our target <end>int and again our location dot get longitude so that's just going to <end>okay yeah and as you can see what we need to use now it's <end>with so it's gonna be so i did that we need to show you how <end>gangster-style just going to hit dot stop and then tts dot shut down <end>good so now what we're gonna do so we're just going <end>so we're gonna call us some variables basically going to be the setting it to loop forever and this <end>basically the bridge from xml and this is <end>this on click method and it's basically you know if we had like 20 buttons work <end>going to delete it within our layout that's what we're going to use spinner in here it's going to have 80 so thoughtreturn collected so now what we're <end>public boolean and say should override url loading and this is going to be <end>our x value so again this just kind of a nice and first let's get into our x value our background or notthen we do if this works and that's pretty boring tutorial guys can keep them <end>all that good stuff because we you know something like i don't know <end>previously as we referred to our <end>created and then we're just going been complete and so all we have you guys will return value say string <end>we're gonna go above our class and we're gonna <end>variable that again like that instead of city we're gonna say temp underscore f and <end>for the and we're just show you can see the <end>make sure it works oops and what <end>our file input stream so <end>rectangle which i'll catch you want and run our viewing it canvas dot draw float and dot <end>again alright hopefully everything works now but uh alright that's better <end>available for it audio manager dot and we define this clear equals and this is our flags and this is <end>by yourself but we're going to say the textview so into our text because we're working with let's check that all kind ofdot set color here <end>but just make sure everything set another location is make it so we're <end>say dot set text to our new string that we just created called the returned <end>gonna set this equal to our actual making and we're <end>slash s ch e ma s android.com forward slash a pk for /li b forward slash <end>and pasted because i set up just hit dot <end>and as you have <end>and it's going to wrap the content the <end>string so there we go basically the first thing we do that is create a few tutorials happens the sd dot as kindhit the notification it's going to open up <end>to copy and paste this click method this for city and we're going to call this display once once our command commands sowe're going to <end>has to say the mode so basically what the mode so basically what the mode says basically so what we called maps we'revisibility of our button in this tutorial anyway so what we can do is we're gonna <end>our textview that we just need to create string <end>going to do is create a string and we're going to <end>method get kind of <end>dot get and whatever so we're gonna do is <end>to be like that <end>okay it brings us here and over you need to click that and so now so now so <end>trying to think what you know that's what we can go in and yeah that's what this is we're going to go uppower but that's pretty much pointless and again this holds configuration and we're gonna say 180,000 seconds and that we have everything thattwo methods that get implemented when we implement the sensor event listener <end>is our bundle that's being passed in a bundle variable again this class and then it's just for simplicity we're gonna call thisandroid and tenth dot set input and we're gonna be good good stuff so i'm just going to say within quotations <end>call this display when those part that's decent name whatever and <end>layout that <end>going to call this and an easy reference for something into this variable we my bring back and as <end>the <end>we're going to implement we see it's just going to implement <end>how to do is create a new class we're going to implement three methods for the most part <end>our manager that and <end>into a variable hot or not gonna set this equal to again just some data java or the string there is we're <end>intent because we want to open an an intent we're going to update method that and then the <end>which again is our drawable item that's being passed in and then we're all the type of a context so that's being passedtable and we also need to do is we are going to copy this cv update for all right so now let's justthat <end>to our in a command and then make <end>floats for our surface view <end>variable and that's the textview we're going to say this text view and then we're going to say if and then we're goingclass we have to do is we have to do is we're gonna say our based off and again we <end>say <end>into our weather xml file or we go we create a while you can click on that for this last time trust meagain type string because that's how you guys can as well adapter for this yet but <end>be as well and right here hit finish and we're going to say add to that will be just like <end>because we're going to align it within quotations at plus id content well and paste it within our statement and <end>actually working with our context which is our listener so watch the second parameter we're just gonna update method within our <end>and we're just going to set up our can write dot set text and you know text view so now <end>gonna say lb voice return so <end>clear button show you in the screen up and basically <end>an xml and case r <end>think about we're going to set this up and so we're going to say string and then we're going to need to dogonna call this our table or actually info we'll call it info and then we just need to create this method that weto context dot audio service so now the tag them <end>up real quick if you guys have first button it's so i'm just gonna run on basically i'm gonna have two string soaround and once sorry if i'm going fast i mean hopefully you guys pick up on this and manifest and also as wellwe <end>our location listener <end>and you <end>we're just gonna times this by four so we're just gonna times this by four so that's pretty much the for byte andjust going to set this equal to persons underscore <end>we two method so we're gonna say our helper something like that <end>called menu we're gonna go within this part of the <end>i'll try fall log <end>event and we're going to call that e and a map view which we're going to <end>private so we're <end>widget which converts into the left batting to the top of the xml thing the first thing that we go <end>be conscious of slower devices that i was location short <end>new boston and i'm just going to say key store hit enter and then we have to <end>either set the project set up again we just have the path once we have the distance over here and we're gonna goimplements location listener like that and again this <end>and if we refer to the value 0 instead of prep to drawing to kind of the <end>and button stop dot set on <end>the gravity equals <end>that's what it's a text find it works and again i just change the gravity within java and then a <end>send this is kind of a random place but a <end>is our display and that's what i'm catch and the pixels and catch and <end>most part but let's say we can say case to our ids that we're going to set button time our <end>going to hit it a semicolon and then <end>well i'm not even leave this actually <end>that toggle button and leave it and we define kind of describe what's ever get into the first thing <end>we're gonna do again we're gonna do is <end>but we're just gonna hit that we did thought the same name as you can see that we're going to finish it <end>the <end>need to do is in is is joined or till it dies <end>going to set our value is equal to the top and if we need to access them <end>that's going to do is you're like next <end>confusing because <end>say dot get it because again we need to throw an exception we're <end>let's take for before we set up your code and we're just going to create a while our line and we're just goingwith we're <end>attributes is gonna be within here and it's gonna be one and we actually <end>final and our dy so <end>we're gonna say canvas dot put matrix <end>not a title <end>pretty much the class that we set the text and we're just gonna call this pi4 <end>we're going to say our l equals relative relative layout find view by d r dot id dot <end>number but you guys to set this point and get everything works so that's for drawable forward each zero and i mean thatcalled set content view we're going to resource <end>to save some data we're going to click that and then we're going to say <end>apk shows all of our permissions that good stuff within the way that it's <end>string list so we're going to refer to here so we're going to say array /list and android <end>our array list so we're just going to call this call this call this data for <end>in street view so we want to turn the street view off the item click that <end>locked as is how to be sized according to be clickable because what i will catch you guys wanna check it out youis a context so private context can't spell and we're just gonna call this <end>current volume on the person's phone and we're gonna say sb dot set <end>apk shows all of our permissions that good stuff within this line here sorry for this tutorial we'll get into <end>the last tutorial we're going to set our <end>can r equals false now what we're gonna say how you don't have <end>there and <end>passing just our event <end>is it so just need to do is set up they mean <end>player dots create context this and resources are dot id dot i mean our <end>we're being pass <end>view like 45 pixels and paste it here in a frame layout we have to put like one we're going to say atdo with until it hits the only time we have some different methods that <end>client protocol exception input/output exception and a <end>breath for reference and say this is a reference and save it and then go <end>of the value of our ball and generally or <end>constructors again one that just handles a drawable being pass in all <end>things i'm going to walk you want see if you want to <end>so we create <end>going to return <end>it's going to again we're <end>we're just cw <end>is using something we're gonna do <end>like a a string variable called send <end>and <end>surface for for <end>that's crazy format and then run a relative layout <end>happens if everything works properly it's this <end>and delete the comment or something into a view that's doing here but don't grab your imports but okay yeah the first thingbrowse and again we're just going to basically you have to the sdk so <end>element and just say disabled client is gl just say disabled client is gl just say disabled client is gl just say disabledway clock now that's just going to say that's what's up <end>just say this is equal to new intent and then the package name we're gonna <end>make sure it's the keyboard so we want our menu <end>travis's and now let's go back menu preferences change your list to <end>what this intent from all this time <end>and then what i did from <end>xml stuff so we're going to or <end>set wallpaper <end>we're going to call this <end>called pass <end>so now it's going to <end>try and make sure it's within <end>toast dot set length be short and then we know we have some sort of an air <end>i'm gonna <end>back surface copy that and then we're gonna go into our excel accelerate <end>you guys <end>all uppercase white like what we're gonna say a bitmap that we aren't giving it within this to do is basically this whatwe're just going to say again like try <end>within this line is just clip the video <end>gonna use that stuff like <end>our linear layout like i <end>we're gonna say our sound pool dot and <end>and i'm going to show you that problem real quickly hopefully when we run <end>parent right so we're going to say set onclicklistener to and we're going to say <end>to send it's the button boston and the key for the user of our <end>same one that we will like this layout called on the view and we're just gonna say an xml real <end>look at one and it'll pull up for <end>http variable which we call <end>part we're just going to wrap the input so we're going to reference android layout or whatever you guys should do as wellto return a string that we want to do is we're going to refer to our null and then whatever is what wehow we're going to <end>your capital a reference is just get kind of <end>and <end>whole class we're going to resource <end>so <end>latitude and there we go in to get when <end>and our can read dot set text to false as well so if we get a false we know <end>going to be public void set city and what we're gonna pass in to this <end>point zero or p buff is equal to a point buffer and with our <end>drawer closed drawer closed listener or set max click that within chitchat and that's what we can use takes a priority and weand we want this holder to be accessible to our holder and then context of your action <end>going to set up a <end>as well so if we've set this equal to be private <end>create method which i moved and <end>but for example if you just said www dot it's not going to work you have to start again our file just myadd a catch clause and output we're going to do we're going to use for this is going to say external data dotits parameters so we click our getting this application hits the moment so we're going to look out of checking method so we'rewithin this catch exception we're going to click that and then we actually <end>a you guys don't <end>let's try are using a new byte and finish off that line but it's nothing too new now everything is going to bestart and we're gonna set this actually let's set this up at the <end>kind of fine-tuning it that well walk activity <end>it again just gonna <end>to refer to do right right there and we're going to say this resource so really need to do right right there sothis page to and we're just so we're just to and we're just gonna be <end>class like when <end>select bottom and that's voice as well and as you can see we have to cover and we're going to use some ofinto it because <end>gonna return so we're going to get through our columns array we need to hit it the row in our own like <end>our intent within java for a <end>we need to do again you might like that says this is an exception e for all <end>we're just going to say again like try and <end>let's just said that but we're gonna say one again that's what our canvas dot decode volume then let's do <end>create method is type out our gl ten and have our x and we're going to define this gl ten object and let'sand then what we're going to add our <end>this variable that's going to null we're gonna say our <end>put one of those straight lines and we're gonna get into the maps activity whichever activity gets called a reference points and typeto change the same as they select this one of we're going to change the same <end>we <end>then you guys <end>a layout and we're going to copy it within its parameters so <end>activity and the an activity so what i applied and i'll give us some space within the manifest <end>so we created our open method with the context of this gets called get sql exception and then we're going to again wewhat we're gonna do is we're gonna say new alert dialog and then we say <end>we can <end>our geo <end>takes within our data class right here i'm sorry if i'm just <end>this webview settings and then <end>our <end>to basically return statement of this <end>because again within here we're going to call this display and again method we'll <end>two methods that get implemented when we implement the sensor event listener <end>then maybe that by ford one more time because that's <end>i've setup on create method now <end>into the manifest and we already have the internet but just to emphasize <end>about and we need to do is we need to do is we need to return a string <end>just going to be our <end>just going to call this toast for the <end>want to throw some throw some exceptions so we're going to say throw a <end>instead of creating our own at the moment so we're just going to <end>stream now so we're gonna just say <end>and in milliseconds we can kind of look which will work and we're going to call <end>we've used for the bundle if everything's fine we <end>the most part so we need to import the onclicklistener so radio <end>priority we're gonna set that so we're gonna do is we're gonna set the zero the screen is a new pair of ourdress dot get max address and we also set the address so we have our if we also we need to be abletutorial will all lowercase end here that but that's how we're <end>crazy so we're also going on touch listener as well and this application <end>now we don't want to mess <end>know you know the command so what we also want it layout gravity and set that equal <end>and save that we set up entries which is a list to <end>within the most part so <end>output is how many <end>with indexes so what we're gonna do is we're gonna see when we <end>point so we're just gonna refer to our location so we're also gonna say dot get make sure everything we're <end>um and we're gonna <end>going to call this and the same kind of passing information or something a <end>we're going to do what's ever get <end>notification was sent so we're gonna refer to what it's not and we're gonna call this n so <end>i'll show you know person and hit control <end>for this because <end>we're gonna go above our on create method we're gonna go above our on create bracket below the <end>start and we're gonna set up a <end>be selected right after our fingerprint here down here <end>even want to fill out of our <end>it's basically it's basically <end>called or using a method called open file output <end>background as well so we're going to say android drawable and that's going <end>which row id we want to have so <end>the current classes so now it's going to go now it's going to go to our sound pool now it's going to shownull within the pause after it's done and it's defined our bacon <end>motion event it right here it's labeled event so there we go pretty much the <end>shoot down here which we set up the textview class now the same thing we call this ad and again we need toimports right click add a again a on create method so nothing new there <end>we're gonna say our imports make an <end>text which we called city at least i did and we're gonna say get <end>update media update files for the user to use something like that so <end>while we <end>switching case in our on click method so we're going to say camera data is what we're going to call <end>want it to actually change because we leave a lot of british data is this basically the <end>we're looking for so all <end>have different pictures in each one class for the most part so just set up in our view and so we have oursometimes without spaces for some reason i don't know why but we need <end>if <end>to this our fx equal to 0 because again it's pretty simple and copy that <end>we're going to which is in quotations again equals and then or whatever <end>that again as you can see the next tutorial we'll get into our view and to our test it i know i hatethe root element for the xml file this kind of gives us a starting ground <end>stream this <end>button stop dot set on <end>what we're gonna do is no <end>and then just say use our file output stream and we're gonna refer to our file our actual object and we're gonna referwhat you <end>the seekbar and say progress <end>an id we're going to say web or our brow again our brow again which is our web view for <end>of how we're gonna do is of the center this left-behind <end>method and <end>http variable which we call this this read some sort of <end>we're going to say we want to setup in a few tutorials do i did to use it's not that setup on touchwant to throw some throw some exceptions so we're going to say throw like that and we <end>everything should get a program so we <end>text right here and then android xml file <end>which <end>by going android that and then <end>equal to new edit text again nothing new here for yes et <end>again going to be <end>this in this layout <end>into the most part we created called public or vert <end>that's 1 and we're going to say like something like what's that's pretty simple layout they're thinner on create method as well we'rerefer back to be basically that is <end>out the website to make sure the javascript is enabled so we're going <end>our extends the xml layout and let's see what we want <end>and we're going to call this and we're going <end>add within our class that i just showed you set up our references again <end>oncreate method you know the <end>maybe leave a comment placing endpoint at the location <end>again i clipped the <end>our data and then we're going to again adds those part and what we're going to do is we're going to again iswe're going to <end>going to go into the item click listener and it has a second horizontal you guys by one in and this on clickspecify that a little bit more we're gonna create a sax parser and this <end>canvas for this we're gonna say is that <end>basically just a time variable within our on resume <end>we're just gonna times this by four so we're just gonna times it's rgb a point byte buffer or we're gonna say pdo is just set up a new type of variable called show result <end>i'm sorry our menu but our image we need to do <end>the developer page it in here out my over here you can do that you guys how to accept this code it's ajust make <end>standard activities for our you know we click this if this command basically this is <end>develop for the which i want to use now the layout where we have to select a into your first name <end>here our path something like that now this is the basic setup for setting up a new project we're <end>with we're going to change it as well so we're just gonna add our imports and now but why it <end>you can and we're gonna say <end>stream so we're gonna say the actual path exists it's gonna call this stream within our actual path exists it's gonna call thisthe beginning and so we're going to define our intent up above our bitmap within the shared preferences class so <end>and we're gonna do is gl matrix mode and we're just gonna say gl matrix mode and we're just gonna <end>and again our alias was named map alias so this is where it's a little <end>release over here but if you guys that and upload <end>basically have everything initialized for the most part <end>size so we're going to say <end>there we go it's equal to this bitmap equal to and then within <end>so vert buff is we're going to need a draw to a buffer since we're working with a buffer and this one's goingpreference so <end>get sensor list and <end>we're gonna say context so it's gonna be our drawable into too much just one has these center context within the context that'suri and then we give the website we want to interpret the data from so <end>specify that a little bit more thoroughly what sax <end>application name sets it now the most part it's checked in this tutorial for now is when it's actually going on and alsoof set result <end>we're gonna be able to save that good stuff to walk through setting up now kind of error out of some information sodo is basically we have three values because <end>about them for a context of our database so we <end>about and we <end>it's <end>hopefully i don't know our map and this is just pathetic i'm <end>get the criteria set up a toast within basically what we're going to use this whole width and <end>we're just going to set up a new intent i equals new intent and then <end>to long mm name and m hotness and so again <end>we're going to set up our bacon and it's gonna call if and it's called on click method that we put in withinclass or a <end>and we're just going to set up both of our on create bundle and now the other thing we <end>as well so can again the gl 10 class dot gl coalface so there <end>class within this class we can still have access to the x and y which is <end>string buffer so we're just going <end>data and we created called path equals internal string and we need to setup our internal data and we set up a stringwhoa so not much the <end>nicely where it's coming up some of your touch the methods from the <end>we're just gonna times that by four so that's pretty much it <end>we're going to say specs and then we have a simple layout is just so just return <end>our string called a class or actually kind of fine-tuning everything that's gonna be working again our voice finish and then all we'rethe video but i this was <end>string then close the keyboard so <end>time look for our next method called timer <end>up happens but as you can kind of talked about <end>like that i don't know no it's getting too late but just show so we're gonna set this equal to i told youdatabase and for the most part and <end>you know make sure it works again this is it run <end>android dot a p-- widget dot action dot an all uppercase app widget <end>somewhere i wasn't learned on setup but uh alright so much stuff on my desktop it's <end>again our url and it understand our file <end>up for us what we're gonna do now we <end>put two subjects but is just showing you guys that you guys that we will set up now be a getting the withsurface class and we're gonna <end>we're gonna say as long as well so we're going to do is we're going to call this <end>store and we also option space - list space - list space - list space - <end>going to do is it's going to loop through 20 times and what this published progress gets called and then we're going tobecause it's going to be <end>down to be this geo point that's <end>if statement when they release so we're gonna say <end>gonna say int max v and we're gonna set this equal to our audio manager dot <end>for the last time your landscape and then <end>so what we want to kind of a on create method about the type of an on type activity class we can usemenu and again we open method and hit dot <end>setting text play hit our semicolon and hit our semicolon and hit enter and we also converted <end>our button so when we hit save that out button and then <end>works again as well <end>have to create a new boston and then we just have two string we need to say a value <end>and we're also gonna right click on pause that you know the oncreate method pretty general <end>and we're just going to hit <end>method what we can use some of <end>basically set that equal to 50 value so we're going to say our <end>application and we're <end>that bridge / bridge over to the xml <end>same one because you're working here we are added reference your ad within our application so <end>variable and we're going to say camera data is what we're going to call <end>trouble reading that because i wanted to chitchat err about oh yeah that's spelled at about all i just you guys want justeverything <end>up <end>we can use dot set onclicklistener to this and our our second tab as well so then we can <end>class this is coming from the wait <end>canvas because <end>that can use all of classes so <end>then we're <end>available to the user action equals new byte array adapter or closed right what our <end>can create a kind of i just set up what am something like that and again it's just gonna say our <end>and then we're also gonna create a new class called gl render or <end>called this that xml file name the configure is going configure again the configure is <end>within our open class and just a little bit better using you know list which we set up now basically reference the variablethink about we're going to call this intent i and we're going to call it intent our new intent basically <end>whatever let me pull this over can you go into finder documents android <end>text play java here and we're going to use it within this kind of clean up within this on <end>everything accessible here for this class within parentheses something like that now we're gonna call this one file name something like that nowsweet you know a pretty much everything works and catch you a crash our i mean it's going to go up the permissiondoes and yeah just to <end>launched when you <end>start and so we're gonna say our sd slider i'm sorry i'm <end>into it and it's going to open that and also no <end>time we deal with strings we're gonna call this green ball so hopefully they do with widgets and now we set our drawablecreate a new boss <end>do again under replacing try and it's gonna do is we're also going to create a new string array and <end>just going to set this equal to persons underscore <end>this so let's see we need to still our <end>website or we'll call whether <end>we're gonna create a new byte from our file input stream because <end>android so <end>asked the question for the most part so let's go back like hey man name that was kind of shut off and alljust called about the add so there we go <end>basically going to set equal to false and there we go we can do is <end>not you guys created a scoop now our activity and then we set it up when we run our blue <end>go up <end>alias maps key store hit enter and then we need to create a password that <end>returning let's just get crazy i have the shared preferences class is again to save in a <end>what we're going to give <end>that is just add our imports and on type string in our edit text and we're gonna say unique id again is apause method so we're just gonna say <end>to throw an data that and we're gonna refer to our file that we need to save and then we just have tothat we put in so let's run our own <end>going to say text-to-speech equals zero and then we defined <end>is a context so private context what i working with on our graphics class <end>might change the graphics aren't that <end>have all we're doing anything and how <end>change it and we're gonna say event event yeah event i'm sorry <end>private so that's what that's what we're going to <end>work here because you guys to delete samantha so let's just had <end>so we're going to give us a <end>we're just gonna talk over here and this <end>blue that we have a rectangle and <end>have to do is generally or closed it's gonna do is return true and it's gonna do is set this up in ourgonna call this string that we say surround this open class but we're <end>temperature in fahrenheit is 77 you can also you know just say whoa whoa <end>mouse cursor but basically before we extended the view class and you know pay pause and i'll show you guys <end>right now it's not doing the one that we hit that we actually want to do is basically before we set up thoseis within here and <end>view have equal to be kind of forgot i mean you go new <end>different again if we use it as a string would be a theme and i'll catch you <end>events you can get the sub method called simple stuff within the on click listener as you set that equal to our waywith actual <end>know it's just make sure everything <end>gangsters gangstas and you know whatever else we want this text view and we're going to say <end>we'll work out of our application make sure it works got that you know make sure it's the front looks something like clearall right so now the id dot use dot <end>then we <end>but it's basically <end>is within here within <end>which we're going to be a notification we <end>here's the google api where we can go <end>we're just going to say it's gonna change just gonna say it's just set <end>take a picture but what alright well hopefully we can <end>say five hundred so it's gonna add some more customization going to say middle rec for one <end>you guys how that but that's for this tutorial is we're gonna implement anything at the moment so i <end>for float and this one's going to be of the triangle to our buffer so for example <end>and <end>can't spell dots decode resource and then we take our bitmap so we're gonna say - bitmap <end>try and this tutorial is because we just need to do is we're gonna say but we're <end>all this on create method and click that and now i'm just something like that so make our text view which is adrawable set up here so we're just gonna say our view by 4 which was it for a read our view by somethingso that's pretty confusing to preferences edit text that splash background <end>going to give it a file name something like that now what we need to do <end>string that so we're gonna do is we're gonna say load some forward slash string because we're gonna do is say the filegoing to be going into our back to your platform should choose <end>we're gonna call our map activity so now what we also converted <end>application and this is our l equals relative relative layout find view by d r and we're just going to <end>and then we're just going to finish it by ford slash less than sign and <end>is because this is everything for its parameters so <end>into a time and seconds we're going to perform an <end>selected it's not working properly everyone does it don't worry about it <end>try that we defined earlier so we're gonna say database and our on create method or here and one for now be privatechange listener something like that to things within this import or listener just create a variable we're gonna say while is running andsend data we're going to say if it's crazy we're gonna say probably right <end>actually closing so we're going to say our database we're going to say <end>so we can go to google maps api or just copy <end>values within the constructor but again <end>gonna say p index so seven six four something like that and then what <end>specify that a little bit more thoroughly what sax <end>things i'm sorry an edit text we're going to call this input and set <end>trouble reading that because i was trying to look at my camera and at <end>again we just need to create this method that we say create method and we're also going to again we have to doyou want the point on the <end>to affect affect affect affect affect affect affect affect affect affect affect affect affect affect affect affect affect affect affect affect affect affectclick for is because it was that we could change because right here now <end>quickly kind of familiar <end>class but just to show you know or this equal to what we want to set up a string f something like thatbut we're going to <end>type something like test1 and we're going to first let's say we load <end>add a tri bracket here is after that manager and catch and we could like a from our string from our string variablespreferences edit text right click <end>we're gonna set it as a location manager called that's <end>gonna say so we want <end>just change that <end>is also the version <end>let's do is we're going to <end>from our returned <end>to the extras from that and then we're going to say <end>function within our map so we're just going to set that up real <end>current volume on the person's phone is the current volume and then we're gonna allow our audio manager class <end>for you guys just further than email and then we implement for as i'll our url we're also gonna be beautiful or whateverto comment out see android r dot layout or i'm just going to <end>can do is we can say float center center x is equal to again our canvas dot <end>with indexes so what we're gonna open this by four so that's good and we're going to set up a private <end>we're gonna first we have that set up right now i'm just going to do is just say our dot add and thenwhat's called <end>just going to set them up so <end>and what we're going to call this check like this image that awesome and you <end>we're going to say one the menu class again hopefully it's going to use our menu class again once we can use <end>cut it i mean it's going to call this file f i don't know new file then in quotations again and we're familiarour set frame rate that animate for you and all that good stuff but i <end>a layout like 100 is android layout and we're going to call it within the code and once they have that the layoutit's just basically it's going to do is learn how we <end>that's the x 1 strings like that or again that we have to return basically and then we just need to return thewrite some kind of a <end>value that we just set this equal to new string buffer and <end>when you guys problems so what i want the next tutorial again for the most part so again we've set up they haveplayer dots create context this and resources are dot id dot i mean our dot play wasn't loading here and then we're gonnapassword was for your alias hit next and then it says destination already <end>basically the bridge from xml so i'm going to say test so what we're going to do is just going to set thisthe first thing i want to go over into our graphical layout but as we designed it in our photoshop skills and <end>going to go shared preferences for our edit text our string variable and we're going to save some <end>dot put string and then we have to have to set up a key and nothing <end>that we will return <end>going to say <end>we're gonna say our rgb a for red green blue we're gonna say zero or in the y <end>activity it's not equal to be the same items within your <end>like point to be transparent but let's make tutorials so if we move to get our renderer and within our on create methodbasically this on draw is going to be looping so we can say changing <end>we're going to say crazy dot next int and then we're <end>basically this through what are again just open up a graphics class <end>everything accessible here for this class for <end>to do is we're going to create a new java class you guys probably <end>lite open helper and then as so my <end>so again nothing new for the most part exception and then we have a instance when it's <end>won't work with basically the sound <end>guidelines of how to set up a <end>for <end>get <end>this code for <end>button called test so we're also going to something <end>gonna say <end>we're just gonna call this class so let's say we have our table name we're just gonna say our database underscore table andthrough our columns in that we kind of basically going <end>our x and a <end>we're just going to hit a array so we're going to give it and <end>say set url <end>and convert it in ten ants so we're gonna say int temp is equal to temp for <end>do is say start activity and then what intent do we want so again we're just equal to plain type <end>box right now when we're <end>being passed in called db and we're going to use a method called execute <end>tells you the methods that we can use and there's a draw method that we <end>we want and we have our current <end>webview here so we're going to say view within here to static final and you do in this would have that up atsetup some two <end>we're going to set this equal to et sindh because we're going to create this horizontally as well i'm gonna pretend like iour way we can set up a new byte <end>add tab and we're going to add a <end>our title and lastly all we're gonna say our button it's gonna go with because we called set this equal to travis cwe're going clockwise that's what we check for our camera is and then <end>we're gonna set up that reference as <end>of what the context which is the top bottom like a class <end>something like the a stands for our ball is drawn so <end>something a little bit new that you guys need to realize when you make one <end>you mess around with the system volume instead of a seat bar to <end>and we're gonna call this exactly what we called you know this <end>async tasks and we say path we're going to say add unimplemented methods so we're going to say add unimplemented methods so we'rethe music for <end>little bit better work with it so that's <end>so i've done with menus we're going to <end>we can put string and then we have to do is basically what we want to open and so we're going to sayand then we say th which won't change that and i'm also the toggle view <end>adapter and within <end>gonna say x equals and we're gonna say event event yeah <end>gonna be when you run <end>that's the same thing <end>say test it does that but we're going to update button is by three key which again this is set <end>something like that to <end>this is within our edit text play our <end>what we need to create this above so what we're <end>want to close our protected data with this array adapter thread is <end>nicely basically we're going to try <end>time we're just gonna add to so we're just gonna say insert <end>we're going to use it to access it <end>to our counter equal to again it's a add find the <end>if it works so again we're just going to try and what we're going to do with a <end>to access them as <end>that that is it's kind of put this graphics and here again that is poorly <end>music because basically we're also going to say we have to do this by saying this array that we can save something <end>going to set this equal to textview and text view results so there we go <end>well put to double <end>touch on touch method basically it's returning false so once it gives us <end>within the take picture switch in case it so we're going to define it <end>intent yet but we're going to listener not working <end>we're going to say set javascript enabled and i'm just <end>we're going <end>again i know our that <end>and again this is set this equal to examples five and it's going to surround this is going to call this cheese variableinto your computer just do anything so just make an ide which i want you guys <end>makes some sense again you know this last tweet method is going to be a while again <end>like when we set up our button <end>true to the context import a context of setting up this because it's just create another thread within the constructor we're <end>i'm hungry with the menu which created this is going to read that again but before we have three options we need toequal back and we also need to <end>make sure it <end>and all the code for a text or whatever you can also as well well so here and all the code for thelayout it's kind of kind of set those a start activity i mean this i mean it's kind of kind of get thebecause it basically equal the <end>so we're just going to say return true so i'm i don't know if that that's <end>parameters or layout params because you know an id that we're going <end>something like that we're going to need to create a uri and we're going to need to set up a line so <end>let me say public class load some stuff in our constructor for the most part if it we need to have to surroundtrouble reading that because i was trying to look at my camera and at <end>the user of our application so it's just going to scroll around as <end>to show results which sliding drawer and paste it didn't the video and then <end>or not class or object we're going to create a new hot-or-not object so again we can set it equal to our positioncan just place it within this crazy just going to kind of delete it out of <end>be pretty simple we're <end>hopefully you pretty much good to be pretty clever what i set up so basically it's going to go and look like thatwe're going to want to show you guys but basically what i press <end>for and forgot kind of <end><end>and it's going into our <end>say new hot or <end>something like that pretty standard i'm going to set this equal to new <end>first for we're actually going to type list view which is <end>doing <end>relative or this the whole widget button within our edit text within here it's going to say android padding and we're going tobecause we're gonna say textview <end>little for the methods but for this tutorial is when we <end>going to add to tv with it out <end>so tv for textview we were in here we're just going to find that we just set up up our test and that'stravis thanks for the class that we have to open <end>like i don't know our viewing area called our gl 10 class dot gl underscore per spekt spective correction hint and we're <end>we run it on it has the edit text we're gonna let or <end>acquire to start it that's what's actually going to start our our <end>we're almost done <end>what's going on <end>database and there we go through our helper which we called sql lite open helper and it's basically going to be private upbutton oh yeah there but we're gonna have a url <end>that that and just click of our <end>gonna add our a command so we're going to right-click i believe it's kind of an hour so there we go down that'sitem called last math below <end>and we get them and again it's almost set the byte order here <end>and then some of these more sense i <end>everything within <end>save it and then we need to type list which is <end>equal to which is gonna add a string called each <end>our package or the java jdk and there we go we set that and that's <end>also just give us some space within the manifest and copy this to like camera application or lastly at an up so againabove our on create method called show results and we need to create our tab host called tab so we can use itthing that i wanted to set up so basically that's why i just change this back <end>then we also do is say text within here pretty easy dp just so that's why i'm gonna pretend like i have thatso yeah we're gonna do is we are on here pretty easy <end>stuff within that folder so how we <end>define it so we're gonna say our thread and then dot start and within the constructor we're <end>our just set has to be basically set this equal to start to is going to set up a layout weight equals newgonna as which is it's centering basically <end>our email tab so we just say plus tab host then we will set up we want our just our <end>starting point with activity opening these brackets there so again they start activity opening these brackets i'm going to say the window tablike that this this <end>the next tutorial will finish this a recognizer intent so this basically <end>the context and we're gonna call this and this is just reference our onclicklistener and there we go now <end>set that equal to be true and then we need to use a order and we're gonna <end>set equal to we're gonna <end>of new boston dot sql lite get <end>set up and click our string variables if you can see there's some stuff because you know our sql lite <end>it's under <end>beginning that you know that bitmap <end>gonna pass in the row which converts into a long from our you <end>dot raw dot and then we can do air for the <end>gonna reference that in the geo coder and travis and the problem i mean because when you guys were just geo coder isrefer to the first parameter we're gonna say sleep for the most part so basically we just created so going to be zerocalled set up our shared preferences of some sort of the last tutorial to define the data and we're just going to callclass what we want because again we're returning a draw to the same thing that's good stuff because that's going to set upand we're just gonna say something like that so again we use the string that means it's called file name and we're goinglike that and it's named plus again that's expression mark called public right here so what we're gonna say if that and it'shopefully you guys see how that all our second button it's a button that up just drag and forth <end>into our emulator and that's where i called i'll probably in <end>then we actually need to <end>we're just going to also what's along and we're just going to do now is click that and this and it's going todo that the same thing that we go to go and you have to talk and add our button and we're setting upwith the menu class we're just going to use all the city or false <end>we're going to set this equal to a new json array passing in <end>this because i believe it's the button start button that we referenced it in java <end>and we're going to create another file for this class so there we go i show you want to do is we wantand then set to also need to do much the right before i applied to as they won't also gave <end>we're gonna do like a four so that's why we <end>going to be able to this java class is when it's not checking if those options something like okay again <end>trying to give us already of a seat bar i just noticed in you will open your content view and let's check thatwe <end>works with try and we have that class and create a new class called gl so they're all kind of close together <end>the gravity within our on click methods the text play whoa so it's kind of clean up your code within this on updateset up our <end>thread so we're going to refer to this variable above and <end>which you <end>button sub and then <end>text is so we're going to <end>and paste <end>button and we're going to give you can do in the reference android layout and as you can also set this equal toframe layout for this to buttons is going <end>and now we need to say here so basically <end>message it's not not gonna use a method <end>just going to be you can see here i think about the next one <end>that we already when i just want to return that reads kind of actually try and it's going to be like that willwe'll see the gl 10 class is the <end>so again we <end>green blue and integer for the most part and just rgb as well or you can just <end>right <end>going to return is this call or object so we're <end>just going to go into our edit text was input and set equal to that <end>go so just you can see what we go <end>that's just so we're going to call <end>after our menu methods <end>gonna say dot toe stop make text like <end>we need <end>going to say location <end>then we're getting this set up so we're going to do is just like a textview equal to new alert dialogue and alsoyou can see if that's how i specified it back to zero and if that's pretty kind of <end>say string buffer so we're going to pass in <end>already touch listener so basically our surrounding try and a catch and it sets it up <end>that we need to do is add <end>add unimplemented methods kind of <end>there all <end>alright so we're gonna say <end>when we go we extended the be like when we run our camera so if we run our little bit don't see whentools in an export signed application package and we're going to insert three p should say uses the manifest and off put inso now we can <end>center it as well so we're <end>we're gonna call this id again <end>within the take picture switch in case it you guys will set up our <end>the right <end>street view to be false and we called <end>a new <end>canvas i should say when it's unlocked so again this variable called resume so all we're gonna do is just kind of ajust closed off our statement with a forward slash a lesson sign so <end>just dot new instance <end>all this method basically that <end>right before we say hey we say hey man i'm just <end>i'm yeah so <end>but just i mean <end>turn and then down below <end>we need to do is we need to be a notification we want to zero for all right because that's just gonna saybreak it and now we're going to set to true or break it and there we go basically it's going to finish ourthat we will subtract xml file we can say we're going to go into our xml file called cool menu called cool xmlfriendly and what else can we set up the exact same <end>and so there we go but we need to use some of the things that that so you can write to <end>there's invisible if we want to make it invisible and there's visible so <end>and let's just stick with on basically be pretty much same one button but you guys well so <end>text so we're gonna create a string to kind of convert our edit text into <end>quotations and dot create a unique we can use its <end>equal to break the switch and i kind of clean up some <end>and that's what this is just like <end>called menu we're going to call this a theme is this intent filter and this is equal to at least lastly that upyou know another space or another plus and what this whole actually going to send this whole test it <end>just going to copy this and paste it within our hotness and again will be and paste it within our hotness and allmain dot this or base contacts dot this air <end>method of our overlay <end>within this time we're using <end>seconds in oops because 100 because when we hit dot set to <end>this equal to new custom pin <end>gonna say <end>alert dialog so we're gonna do is we're going to say <end>that's being passed in which they call that layout that we need to change the id again we're going to set up thissource again override implement methods and not under it's not under a touch <end>button and that's about the button and we're going to call the references set like that hit save it as well so we'rethat's my you <end>yatta print stack trace again <end>here whatever you guys want and certain data and for text view class text view class name which is which again <end>make any other type of variable we define the type which is going to hit dot and then dot <end>but we'll get it to zero or we're going to <end>where we have three <end>called a gl capital l example <end>call this time and there we go i <end>database and we want to update database we set up an sql lite <end>object say string we're going to set text we're going to call <end>button password reference and the last thing we have to <end>there and hit that in parentheses so we need to do is <end>and you know it's set up a pending intent i'm just going to call this pr we're <end>methods that we can use for this class i should say over source <end>want our project go in add <end>the string basically which basically that basically that we did in case so we're going to put a string we call it rightthat will change that but yeah it's still i know that we got that but for watching guys i mean it's on thestart let are getting this tutorial so just make sure everything should get into a little bit more thing a little bit nicerdo is we're going to <end>within this menu or something for some most part and we're <end>is <end>listener or something new it's going to go we need to do on click listener as well so we can say flippy dotand the key reference and this activity result and this <end>so we just need permission to our <end>the last tutorial so let's check it out what we need to get <end>button start and again and we're going to use for stopwatch from xml forward pretty get rid change the next tutorial we'll getwhich converts into a textview so we're going to do is just close and there we go now let's just me travis outputand then we're going to use our string or <end>dot put and then we're going to set up a buffer and then we're just gonna times this by four so that's prettyso again every time we set up so you don't have a lot of text view but that's what our preferences and that'sdefault value i referring to our string so we're going to say string values it's useful we're just because it takes two stringsfor the most part looks like oh yeah for the context of this string in there so thanks for this class which ishave our constructor we're going to import bitmap and we're gonna say center y plus our down and that's gonna have a tryand then it to was it equal to our location <end>sure it we're going to use the on click listener so we have one of the things in the next tutorial for thethat as well and we're gonna say if location manager set up an locations hit dot get passed in int so we're goingscroll down to one or again it's not in the list list activity it's under <end>to call <end>stream because <end>save it as we set this checkbox if so what we're going to just say name is the <end>have wanna have a pretty much good thing i don't have been set up a new there we go we have our bodyrecognition class again a recognizer intent and we're going to say dot <end>dot get system because we've defined so we just need to do now it's <end>something like that we don't aren't edit text there we go we want to you know <end>it's going to do is we're gonna work with our references the <end>everything is we don't really <end>equals true we can read and write write and within here is where we're <end>important one is going to look for where you guys ever get before <end>and then set this array called <end>of this activity that there so there we go <end>package name just hit finish <end>oncreate method here so <end>method called url and this r we're <end>we're gonna say add a geo coder and according to our app widget <end>start watch break and then we're going to call tab as well we're going <end>something new for the most part and we just set up an r dot we can label that out here finish <end>to call this one preferences and then for the id we're going to just kind of probably have our url whatever we havewe're going to say is create a dialogue so <end>the most part if we hit finish and again <end>set up and we're going to surround this time changes we want to reference <end>house within our second tab as well and i'm sorry which was <end>from zero and then that's just a way we can do air checking so we're just gonna say <end>format it and there we go we <end>pretty much the core concept where the id which is we're going to say r dot and there's a good activity and theand then when we hit the <end>right now let's check out of this go so now this is just dot and text even though we have to import theinto our button button is we're going to <end>if it works again just be seven six then <end>quickly we want to change like run into like run into a tree or <end>actually doing is gl <end>buffer for now is we need to do is create that top so again we're just gonna insert our <end>we will equal is going to call this temp and you know all of <end>create method which i moved for the sensor class i moved for the context or a normal and <end>little bit better maybe do like i mean it's kind of copy if that we created called our regular picture because we basicallysomething we're just going to say toast dot toe stop make text <end>is we're just gonna kind of good stuff for the most part so make sure you guys mess around with the ad viewpicnic so <end>going to copy we just set up our <end>like okay <end>the most part so there we go i'll <end>you know it's going to do is just add that reference as always <end>and what we're gonna have <end>let's just test it and change our text setup or we're setting up a regular button results so we're just going to deletefor the most part so basically when you guys <end>say like that and basically this is running in dialog something <end>and we're gonna go we're also gonna be <end>gonna do is say int so we're gonna say context dot and we're gonna say context dot and we're gonna say context dotof <end>well first something like that we need to add our our intent action name and this time what that you're like this thexml ns ads equals and then we have to put in http colon forward slash <end>seconds and milliseconds for stopwatch application now when we just set up a textview <end>bitmap type object or i'm actually we <end>that's true to <end>and we're going to call this integer array equal to like progress <end>our string buffer so <end>set up a new type of variable along result and this is going to be equal <end>and we set up some boring and we can see even with previously so again our again our indices as well and weclass as db helper and we're gonna extends the parameters for our database <end>going to return so we're going to return a string that the first row id and we're going to have a good <end>that we can do or actually this one not very self-explanatory less of <end>and then we're gonna say because we're gonna do in the <end>up samantha so this command pretty much it up our <end>just a lot easier we'll <end>be so <end>same one button the same layout of our program for debugging so just set up our preferences xml file we'll probably go newis <end>save that that's other <end>going to set up our array adapter is just typing a ray adapter russia <end>into something new class called gl 10/10 object or three <end>change this to horizontal you know at plus id forward slash a frame layout that in there just throw one tv with jsoneverything going <end>java for the moment but basically we set up an integer variable that's equal <end>increment by one and now what we're gonna do is we're going to say kind of exception the pixels and the end valueagain everything that you guys want to be our configure activity so add <end>now has <end>something like when two integers or we import our our preferences and again we just have <end>and we're just gonna say gone one of this so within this activity that we will say you guys i make sure everythingset up a method type of the bottom and that's how you and again that's boolean checking method called draw <end>from eclipse org /downloads we're going to say going to copy all these as well and the right listener so just follow <end>onclicklistener and it's done and it's done and it's nothing so it's giving us an <end>about and we are going to return a deal with how this is for the most part so <end>can have within our as for our input type we're going to use a <end>right <end>can't write there we go and so in this one we're gonna say <end>information it's going to set up as <end>quickly kind of review here but you know the table layouts something a little <end>new string and we're gonna say local name and it's gonna be one and we jump <end>get <end>onclicklistener so we're going to say add a new tab dot set <end>going to parse <end>something like that and we have an activity <end>now as well first <end>clicked this cheese <end>we delete this activity i'm just to show <end>gonna call this touched point class we're gonna call this touched point something like that we're gonna create a half a y ispool object sp and then just import or sound pool and we're gonna set up <end>is just say one of our layout for the most part then the resource as you can see the sd dot set <end>that we're gonna pass we're going to go button that has <end>variables so we're gonna change <end>a button so b sub for b or something like maybe 20 so <end>might get into the preferences <end>guys kind of understand <end>let's actually access <end>pause or when we aren't actually needing it so we're going to say longy is equal to basically casting in <end>our drawable folder it's the density image it's going to go promise guys want to mean don't really get rid of those buttonsour again to be <end>even after we have our preferences and again that we need to do is we're going <end>methods so now what we're gonna <end>again we just gonna create your database and we're gonna extends the sql lite open open basically set this equal to be underscoreand type what this action name for <end>sorry and duration toast dot toe stop make a package name like a new class so we're going to click you guys wanthave a specific <end>logged in and you're a developer and everything you're just going to add some sort <end>of the views now when we click on the java how it why i created it <end>kind of <end>what this is just <end>give you guys are on <end>something like that up guys will open your 107 androids toil for edit text a just want and then edit it then editbitmap on create <end>what our <end>reference here so let's <end>save that and also that will give us all that other customization that we <end>have to do is <end>kota for and now basically like this like set up a geo <end>you can see there's a <end>right <end>also going to return a string which is gonna be equal to point first class that we want <end>return so let me format everything <end>kind of a string and then we have some options we need to say notification but now we're gonna say system current timehey i just make sure everything works and we're going to take some sort of what we're going to go up again againwhich isn't in the z2 plus 1 instead of minus <end>do and then we're going to also say our brow for our web view and then we're going to use the http clientpromise you guys is basically going to be our pin object being pass it again <end>underscore menu dot xml again all lowercase and then you'll save <end>we're going to set this equal to again our for loop <end>current volume and we're <end>our say android and drop it to be what we want to cover so we're going to wrap the content of the firstnext tutorial so i'm going to change this to know ii do is we're going to find it so hopefully we see ibut make sure <end>we're actually going to wrap the reference so my bring back and run a linear layout that all everything else so we're justwe set up and basically the emulator because there is no email actions for the methods that i always and you <end>we're gonna create a new pair from the file name for this activity class i mean it's going to set up a afew things that we set up <end>set this to f y and within this our x and that <end>our final y and basically <end>device is up here and then when we set to it's <end>good review here async task and then we want a string reference anta juror <end>we have <end>well i'm not necessarily our start our event event dot get fit get x and seconds we're going to perform an <end>eclipse and under this windows tab for for if <end>line scale we're just show you import the location and we're just gonna relate to our map prompt so if you guys willfull key reference so it's a what's <end>going to copy and then check box and i call one for for example we're going to say item and <end>know what we're gonna say is coming <end>that but this for a common trick that we set <end>android and tenth dot set type and then give it that by now at comm dot extras when it we want to workinto that activity that <end>send et so we have everything set up our case button has which would be <end>we just know the text called <end>plugin for eclipse and scroll down <end>going to wrap the content id as well and basically a little <end>basically again a string builder so we're going to call this one url it's a <end>so this is a receiver and we need to set up this to like camera and we also <end>so <end>whatever make sure we have something for this toggle button and as well and it's gonna actually we need to add our xmlgoing to be the android we have to import the extras that's gonna be and hit enter and then just again we haveexample class and you say th short and we're going <end>have to do real quickly is set up instead of <end>getting the methods that makes sure the next tutorial <end>for windows for the right listener because that's available here for us as have the adt plug-in and here <end>volume it's going to be on our intent up up with the notification to our taskbar there's an unique id it's gonna berow that and as well we set up a key which we're gonna say if we can return that for <end>basically we have to put our float array in there which we <end>output stream exception and now what this means it's pretty standard in the concept but we saved and there we hit in andlatitude and for my longitude i'm just gonna again type in some numbers let <end>you mess around with and again we can do the same layout and again we use is <end>you import that we're going to <end>like that instead of <end>so we're gonna say private final context or our gl you again is being pass in and a private or again we calleverything is create a little series is i'll just get the only time we could change this we're gonna draw to so whatbecause i mean this activity to go into our class and let's just go to <end>button as a while loop <end>this so we're going to divide it by 4,000 el and then we're going to divide it by 4,000 el and then we'resounds good stuff and there <end>need to set up our progress dialog is what i need to save but for again we're going <end>basket so we're gonna say basket and we're gonna just say new <end>we're going to set this equal to new something like that we need to do is just say path <end>which again and then <end>we <end>within this bracket here and we're going to right-click we're going to right-click we're going to right-click we're going to go down <end>check this is right guys remember where you just say probably are basically just the same way we hit enter and i'll catchand scroll down but just follow along through this <end>of a concept where you might want to do is we're going to change that and we're going to be like that <end>we're going to actually use this <end>gonna say two gl just for two columns in here so what we're working with triangles so that's good and just set upand just say add view and then what view are we going to go through this is this this and and <end>it this so we're gonna have this <end>we were in add the default for the tutorial so <end>and i'm sorry for <end>and such as <end>then again we need to do five fifty so <end>called shared <end>xml layouts so there we go up now nothing new java instead of them just one because i hate this command so ouragain again is we're going to say this as well so we're just going to call this <end>there and click that or again just a new hot-or-not object from our entry because we also need to do is we canchoose apk files going on you again it's a road view or three apk file it's going to show their okay yeah that'sthe string that <end>command so we're going to refer to our variable called a string like set up our we're going to determine <end>us some sort so <end>layout we want to pass in and we're going to do is we refer <end>and we can say <end>time line and we're going to pass a string <end>back <end>you scroll down to your class and check it make sure it should be by going to say sql sql lite <end>player dots create context this and resources are dot id dot i mean our <end>medium mounted what you know this is <end>entity again nothing to new there we're also going to set up an if statement of some sort of a good stuff soandroid title to also put <end>choose some other links that you may want to download from that might go <end>mouse cursor but basically before we extended the emulator again and i'll scroll down to the view <end>method within our class that returns a json object so we're just going to say prefs or our dot sql <end>up i set the <end>going to be a response so we're going to say text for our way <end>within parentheses again the exception type is called class not found <end>into our <end>anything or and i mean that again this is set <end>ten dot move <end>reaction up so type that out and that's <end>good but every time so now what we do is our imports but basically when you <end>want to say 300 or 320 by 100 and this is dp or both and then lastly we want <end>construct something from the information that that so we got to import that and it again okay again just basically just create issay dot and we're going to say is equal to and then we have to our isn't <end>that we just set up what we don't have a crush on our class and there we go <end>all we're going to do is say this is <end>we have this resource <end>text to <end>and first this image it's transparent here is kind of open that up to xml it's transparent for the most part so ourlittle bit more program that so it's just going to say hey is create methods that we click that <end>have this stuff so again <end>release of our delete y and our - our starting y and our - our starting y and kind of have the sleepbrowser our brow something like that and now we can do like oh yeah a little bit <end>first point so how it <end>gonna call this n and <end>will equal to null so we're just going to say again like try and <end>layouts and then <end>from if everything works again copy that and a context again that's where we need to throw an exception we're going to setmuch what <end>bitmap and then basically what the the results okay its data and then our second parameter basically what that string bitmap all thisof our base contacts and we're gonna say our event of the pixels and according to where we touch on the screen sowhere we need to add our upgraded apk on the <end>process and then also what we need to run our dialogue and we're creating our load data and then it loads so ithrough everything that's basically this is actually let's run it should <end>collected initially equals null when we hit a sleep for loops yet i mean this while loop you <end>just really explain <end>pause unpause and we're gonna say on resume so now what we can do is we <end>for <end>wrap content is the other option you can do and basically this is going to just that you can do that also fillcould set it out because that's when <end>type so now we're just criteria and we're gonna import it and we're <end>that basically <end>listener to is just on create new tab as well and we are just set up a spec so all we're going totravis thanks for the class we just have to do is we're gonna say zero and this is we're gonna say zero andactivity it's under a regular activity we have a method called on options <end>gl 10 object and we're gonna say gl dot i keep all we have counterclockwise all <end>gonna say int max v and we're gonna set this equal to our audio manager dot <end>get the time for the <end>that we will like this pretty small so copy <end>actually let's do if changing y is less than a canvas dot get height then <end>from it and that's true we want to save that we need that eye <end>and we need to do that is we're gonna say get selected item position and that's going to send a getting all ofuse this crazy just gravity dot hit gravity <end>setup our imports right there so here's a <end>available here so now what we need to do is we're going to create a new string and within here we're gonna <end>type of dialogue so we go now what we're gonna do here is we're going to say dialog dot show so <end>we're just gonna call this so we're gonna <end>nothing new <end>show you how <end>flag of our keyboard after we're done with this edit text for the most part so what this code will hide it <end>basically this on draw is our changing y and at the moment it's just going to actually let's put that in parentheses sogoing to do is it's no no reason why <end>this tutorial on <end>so now this so what we're going to go in and if you because i'm going to say name and this is whatwe're going to say our our second tab if else or if statement so we're going to say <end>part so we're going to call this <end>basically <end>what this in a handle yet i just take a <end>going to be the same layout <end>we're gonna draw <end>that's how to do so probably in <end>with we're <end>of our widget provider and <end>zero which will be pretty simple with along and break now <end>class within the parameters right now because again through the context of the release thing of the release toggle between nothing too muchset text and we're going to do is set this equal to left we're gonna add <end>is equal to again notification manager and we're just gonna say get <end>except this new business going to say middle <end>your <end>that we set up our json object so yeah <end>on pause right there and then we're going to call this is just going to say wl dot release and as <end>arraylist and we need to say is results <end>this check what this if <end>of our state that is going to be one it's pretty <end>buff so there we go now we need to enable is a float buffer is the y axis 0 the z direction werefer to a switch encase here we're gonna just say path equals environments because we're just gonna say case is gonna say withinpoint zero because again <end>story will reset this if-else statement and basically it's going to check if <end>again this is <end>actually want the manifest of how starting point activity if still all i know <end>to set up an if statement if our status is equal to 200 if we need to set this equal to our responseclass the second parameter the emulator <end>then once we are good the x value our background <end>say as long as a request code is equal to basically our check that's <end>row four index row for table has been set up that we want to do is looking for <end>java for the moment but basically we set up this check command so let's jump into that air as well and it's goingline is doing we're gonna see our gl point buffer or p index we did previously so you know we want to <end>something like that i call this r this and we're gonna say as whatever our class so we're just gonna say remote viewsyou guys do a string and we're going to be asked the next tutorial will actually copy and you guys because again iswe're gonna do is set up they do well or it and so we're going to rename <end>so we're going to say bitmap is equal to and that's equal to and then within <end>dot set gravity equal to line of sets up our drawable <end>we're going to refer to the user so what we're going to set up a string reference that or show display something liketo copy and it sets it up for the street around with and then all we're gonna do <end>starting out with import it real quick i hope you guys will remember <end>switch in when we just set up <end>so we don't want to do so we're gonna say on stop sorry our song and it takes a content view to ourcreate method hit okay so for this for this for this for this sensor event the accelerometer exists called manager just a clickof our graphics and java thing just set that up guys welcome to write and <end>it let's get you guys guys how to set up that <end>going to be a new there as well like that we have to do it for application we need to do it toguys want to do is create a new string for the most part and eggs but we're also going to say dot <end>stuff class and then we're going to surround this method or instance of those are returning and we're going to set this equalwidth because i think that's what's giving us a problem like 274 <end>and then we're just going to finish it by ford slash less than sign and <end>do it but the method is called our variable we define our thread for 288 milliseconds for the most part this catch exceptionssource override implement methods and as you can see right here we can pull <end>is looking for a checkbox is to get it so that's just for the most part and send exceptions for file those areequal to be our <end>we're just gonna call it geo code coder or something like that we're gonna <end>now i'm going to say from a password it's travis again travis and validity <end>but we can create so let's see if we want to show you guys can see this it's nothing the exact same forthe whole canvas for the most part so we say client is basically this 0 the x <end>comm dot google dot ads dot ad view like that and we <end>and it's going to be able to use it's just going to set our viewport and this time it's going to be onarray array and we're gonna need <end>and now <end>png so it's going to <end>setting text in this class called gravity center and i <end>- and signs and then we say why is not equal to zero as well because <end>name that <end>gonna change our intent so <end>client and we're going to call this test something <end>is just gonna do is we want so we're just going to say path equals let's use our <end>of the first thing <end>gonna add this has the last tutorial getting the java so we're just gonna basically the because we want <end>information about how to null so it's going <end>variable setup called our song all we have to do our song and we're gonna say our class name <end>to clean out with me within the <end>kind of give put that okay or is that okay or is that ok are you guys done so we're going to startso what that we're going to call this to set up a <end>setting text in this tutorial as well even though you guys kind of clean slash less than set gravity makes sense right thereview through the id referring to the parent right <end>there we <end>this class and then so we want it might just say getting passed in again <end>something different within our menu and then just like this <end>for xml stuff that you know if it's giving us an reader which we want to look for the things that there forknow it's pretty simple stuff and we're <end>how much <end>documents and open <end>view are <end>include text so just say one textview and then we will take up a command and preffer our text setup or whatever yousay sd there and say open <end>and we can <end>is also <end>and grab the entire class and cut i mean this it's going to go into our handle it and cut i mean isame one of our first thing <end>into the sdk or what you guys get into just gonna do and we're gonna do and open and all over here andnow then we are yeah we need to redefine our tab here in <end>position zero and everything set up our imports <end>some stuff so <end>so we're just setting that going to be true so it's just talking about it extended the <end>x and there we go we set up but i call this x and there we go we're gonna do this is <end>going to say text-to-speech equals new text-to-speech this takes two <end>of the same name another ball and then we have to do is say <end>just going to go <end>text that we need to add a notification i call this n and <end>view which will get menu overlay <end>up to something <end>define this open class width and manifest as well you'll be we've read up guys welcome to your configuration up i show youwant to change her to reference sqlite database so we set up that <end>same one that we will create which will get four yeah no it's so we realize when you <end>null so now what it <end>change this is basically and there we go we can do is set <end>called another icon will be painted to load of give reference of give reference of give reference give reference of how big ourthe camera is gl <end>this command show you how this is just going to <end>we're just gonna times our first vert a gl ten object within it to put point one and then we just gotta youthat and it but this and dot get the extras just <end>pretty much the type of some sort of code that within our on draw within our where the order of into too muchimplements location listener like that class is going to be doing anything we're good to set up a drawable for the most partwe're also going to use our edit text what we're gonna refer to one let's go into the first thing we set upwithin that we call that arraylist called a context that's being passed in for the type of a context so we need toand we have our <end>and drop <end>we're gonna create another file name which is <end>this controller or control yeah controller and add this and we're going to <end>we're going to say start <end>alias maps key store hit enter and then we need to like that we're going this tutorial is describe our layout by fordour string buffer dot to string and <end>this because we again we're just going to call this <end>which <end>again it's not under put the splash activity the sound <end>create and we're just going to say our database helper and it's going to say plus equals new intent something like that weinto our project go <end>within the on <end>button the right <end>role i guess it's not again this so there we go now as we set up our <end>we have set up and paste it and this is within our application i can i applied for <end>that's that's <end>into our value for example we got this two string and then our value our blue <end>was our dot xml and we're going to have two <end>audio manager dot stream music and again that's just the type of add some crazy to equal <end>work and it's still gonna say to result so i'll leave a good <end>there so basically those are up your resource and basically <end>the same thing that we set up this variable that we added wall <end>and then <end>collected initially equals null when we hit our load url and then we're going to give us the shared preferences and if wethat's being passed in for this tutorial we're gonna have a few and so we're just gonna say it's going to set thisgonna update entry something like that we copied <end>this this code as we need to type so we're going to say <end>second and again <end>string that we set up a file according to our actual path to our file input stream within this <end>have another thing <end>webview here find view by id and then we're just gonna say our dot id dot <end>we're gonna do is say dot gl underscore per <end>that we defined earlier so we're going to passing is also <end>surface view so let's set that up guys welcome to your uh what basically our variables so what the environment as well asprevious tutorials as well but i is set up this string that so we're giving it <end>isn't <end>under a resume <end>going to say string integer and string and i'll describe what that means <end>text play display so we're going to set up your application right now let's check it basically all lowercase and then we're goingwe're familiar with our on click <end>this first string and then this is basically our returned hotness so there we go <end>that if they start because you're going to add two those and we just need for the most part now the new bostonthe type of stuff but just change the same concept it's not quite so example and hit enter a few tutorials you knowthings within this is not equal to zero as well because again <end>view which we call show result and we're going to say dot we're show results <end>let's say this let's put <end>collected string of <end>so now we're <end>so there we go in the xml layout and there it's say the system clock so this is the manifest and again it'sfirst so we're going to reference our <end>which was called full url like that and again we're going to set this <end>of that <end>we're gonna <end>into a map view <end>reference called status <end>except this time we have some customization going to start everything in called the amount of <end>something like when we go basically <end>gonna be our splash <end>have a text within our class and we say th static properly but you know <end>we're gonna give that method that and we're going to pass in our long class or the <end>variable to be an intent kind of what the type and we're going to say camera data and we can use the methodthing to be our text then it's going to say text then it's going to say <end>with indexes so that's why is we need to put four something like that and we're gonna do is we're going to nativecomm dot ad view like that and it's mountain orientation because we also have one one tutorial <end>is a shared preferences of our shared preferences of our internal data something like that example we haven't done <end>whatever that works then what we're going <end>define what this is running variable is which is gonna be boolean so we're gonna hit dot <end>guys just make sure the javascript is not in <end>up in our edit text in there for like <end>the <end>go through this string and it's going to be recognized <end>the only other thing we need to do is we're going to say string in a backpack and there we click that andit's kind <end>to do again put the backpack to say the class that <end>this but now go into like <end>constructed because if you <end>class is not null right at the beginning and change that has of a little bit more in this <end>well so again when it's pretty guys to be able to be able to go down to the bottom or vert a shortmethod <end>hopefully you guys see how that all our second button really just check our title it's being called the most part <end>be set clickable so we're going to do is set up a new boss in through options such as well and just continuetextview we're going to say for a layout i will catch you guys want to <end>layout find view by using this checkbox edit text type whatever and we're just going to do so we go to xml andyou know our state where we can read and write and can w equals false here <end>and we aren't getting is it's going to <end>going to be so <end>gonna say new input source and we're gonna refer to our website or url <end>this so we're just going to be really you know this setup here so we're going to divide it by 4,000 el andgonna call <end>change <end>ball so we're gonna refer to our file that we set up here and so <end>a string we're getting in quotations again this is gonna add some values of variables to loop so now we don't have tosurrounding those triangles then it's not <end>by yourself but we're going to say data we're going to open that and then we <end>toriel's go add our compass and now we'll call it where the latitude and latitude so latitude and latitude so no <end>a default value so we don't try our square of again we're just going to be which i this is we have everythinggoing to be our city again this is our info dot to string and we're gonna call this city with this is gonnacan't find a little <end>is pretty simple and <end>text we're <end>then what we are all when we use some of the methods from the android <end>reading so we're going to say result is equal to basically result as it's <end>dot-com 4/1 ford / statuses for / user underscore timeline dot json so <end>documents and hit save everything else so we're going to call this equal to horizontal you could delete it and that's what ito save file output <end>we're going to set the things so let's just paste another something we're going to set like that we're gonna <end>and we're going to give it but we're probably going <end>i don't know why but just set that up <end>same one that we will say an <end>is go into our on create method and we're gonna say set content view to to <end>going to say else we're just going to start it over changing y is equal to <end>but we're just going <end>if there's the time to show you how to do <end>part we're going to <end>gonna parse information <end>so you guys <end>client protocol exception input/output exception and a <end>checkbox is unchecked and also option three is selected even after we exit <end>we're just going to be a long and we're also gonna <end>touch listener within the view and then what this is a new xml layout back up in the <end>as well we're gonna call this mp and then we're gonna call this mp and then we're gonna call this mp equals stopthat's what <end>well because we use that to set up so what i mean this <end>something like hey is just kind of a shortcut there so now let's set them going to call this is as well becausealright so it's not but it's just for the folder it's a lot of look this get method that get into our listof true or like checking here and that's where that's from the canvas so we are good to false <end>that layout we called get into the activity that we set <end>think of the example we can use some of this if <end>well basically going to put a constructor constructor constructor as well that again that's <end>i'll try fall along and just get this set up and this is great reference <end>then we switch over in the landscape mode some of those buttons would run <end>release our x&amp;y changes which happens every time we say is <end>all we set up a and type of this activity that data is the last activity this bread basically our intent which willdot let's not do that by right-clicking and we say open class not equal to do for the fourth button we're going <end>it yeah everything's fine and then we're also going to say result and all that is going to be the class and alljust reason that's going to go any recognized within the <end>it the code <end>this with our stopwatch application <end>going to change the content view and we're going to hit <end>our show result <end>android and basically all <end>we want to <end>we just need to set this <end>can't find it we'll edit the video most part working with you know our <end>method basically this run method we need to change <end>saved it again we can <end>then i <end>little series is we are good checking if it's valid this because the most part set up <end>release so we're gonna say motion event dot you know <end>what we're going to <end>class real quickly and i'll catch you guys have this <end>event and we're going to <end>don't even need to say our surface dot us a context so we're just going <end>prompt and we're <end>a controller now controller is going to do is create some of this <end>but just save but just get <end>something like media player mp equals media player dot create and context <end>use i <end>process and access some of that information but that's pretty much <end>and it's pretty <end>or highlighted or whatever <end>our line and that's just going <end>text and you know again a row id and then type list so now let's go into it <end>and resume from <end>into the table layouts also going to reference and paste it <end>we're going to <end>and you <end>else just kind of a string <end>going to do again within here is just kind of state it sets all we're gonna set up to say hey is <end>know the <end>and you guys see we will return <end>our string that then what we're going to add a catch clause and what we're <end>and then we're going to save it so we're just gonna exit out perfectly so let's get into our button i mean whereagain that instead of city we're gonna say temp underscore f and <end>array and then i know you <end>that make a project specs just the screen and drop <end>starting point nothing new there called it right our intent back and then we're going to just <end>there we go we go just restart it so we're going to add to <end>we're going to copy this whole thing and we're also going to go pretty easy last vertice let's also add to say negativedo anything with this intent type again nothing new my will value it's going to be our app widget manager equal <end>within the take picture switch in case it you guys will <end>from our variable up our <end>intent i we're just saving just kind of value of what the method <end>we're going to set up an activity for result and this is <end>dress going to call that <end>want to throw strings or <end>once it returns it's going to say insert as you know it's going to call it's going to return true we're gonna saybuild the geo point <end>our view of our <end>everything else <end>get hotness we set it so that's it <end>and we set that up our edit text within our edit text within our layout i fill parent i believe <end>a class gets initialized for a constructor but what we need to do is we could probably set up a <end>variable that we're getting pass in plus you know maybe a space and then <end>create method hit enter or let our on move our <end>keep within the activity tab we can find <end>and then just start whatever we set up an output stream and we're gonna refer to our file that we can go tobuilder and we're going to <end>setting text in this tutorial as well right there and run this if else just gravity is currently display dot <end>so we're going to do is say file name like that so <end>summary summary equals a check this box for the most part nothing <end>to be <end>array called get method something like that my then it an xml and we're going to create a <end>bitmap factory decode stream because it's referring to our class changes it's and i'm sorry if it's not allowing us to do soquick review <end>gonna say our list view which <end>this e type we're going <end>have a set their background <end>toriel's go add our compass and now we'll have you a reference that e dot add a controller is equal to our <end>something like that in a second the get some sort of initialize method or imports which will get name which was <end>which is and the duration toast dot <end>and just one have them <end>string and title it a few times nothing new intent and we're going to refer to this and we're gonna call this actioni'm just <end>random values we're gonna call this canvas equal to is our holder and <end>going to say key underscore row id and it's a lot of give us with our hotness and it's going to be 1to put this in so right click source implement methods and let's see if <end>intent just seeing if we actually request code within that that we set up this intent i actually if you can see itthere so let's say is not in our what we're gonna do is when that's basically gonna say null so that's basically gonnakind of separate those two and we're also going to change to <end>our canvas name type of our <end>default value is the string value called lists so we're gonna go default value <end>called a theme so this is a receiver and we're gonna have <end>going to do that by setting up and and then what <end>send data we're going to say surround with that other ids of code along down here we're going to send the case ofreleased when the on pause method gets called i'll just test their <end>this new android xml we add some of our or our references of <end>hotness i don't know whatever our class can just <end>whatever is the progress dialog and all we're going to say string f for this string and then we have some sort ofto be a string variable called can w which is some stuff within our class here we're gonna <end>continue does is can media is gonna be boolean so we're gonna continue again we could change this kind of review we're gonnaand that'll tabs does so i'm sorry it's pretty simple again we're gonna say android layout left oops i'm sorry dp for optionsso just cut that up now you click on this to so just close their <end>application is unique id and we're gonna set up and we're gonna call this get <end>model mode and then it's gonna be on draw where <end>item type arraylist so again we have our arraylist called pin points and <end>be useful we're also gonna say save activity class we're gonna call this <end>android apps and generally what a basically just the same as and we also have to say add there or you go wefor so that's what we're going to call this base url as long as their own within our class that statement <end>permission uses permissions and then over here again for the xml make <end>be working with kind of an overview of code there we <end>that but when we go we didn't want to make sure it was kind of show you some of those four things upto say class for example class again it's not too difficult i mean when we click <end>do is just going to implement runnable and i'll explain this <end>pretty much done this this class then i just want to add our <end>class name which was xml data collected and we're just going to call this <end>construct something from the xml and also do is create a and we're also going to use this and that's what this soa little bit further by one int for a few different sizes that we also going to say <end>in so we're just gonna times this by one and then we have float buffer or we're gonna relate to <end>values so we're gonna say x equals y equals 0 so what we can even delayed <end>requirement speed accuracy altitude some of all that and now <end>type so we're <end>this is in case this is <end>so we're gonna add all it's looking for example and make sure <end>that holds boolean so we're just gonna say what's up it's up and that's just create a new overlay item now what <end>to have a <end>determine whether is <end>async task and then we're gonna say string and now we have <end>have this so now what we have a widget should have there as we have that but let's see if we need toso i don't want to say start and android layout and we're just going to textview we're going to change our content sostring for update our down looks for this <end>be <end>into the pending intent and we're gonna call <end>say show results and we're going to do is set up variables and this is basically it because we've done with parameters ispackage again okay i which i'm just going down to that we're extending the superclass for the methods from the xml layout thatall we also set up some sql view within our constructor for <end>tutorial is using something called the tutorial pretty quick tutorial guys being pressed it still our slider class we run but you <end>layout left what what our content view to was it r dot id dot and we're going <end>again it's looking like what this is kind of show you <end>view here so just like when we had like get invalid and this add view and then all we're going to do iswhat we're gonna say <end>to do that <end>current volume and pass it an hint and then we're gonna allow us to implement <end>can use some resources that it's going <end>going to hit plus and that's being passed in we're gonna say cursor our cursor that we set <end>found the point to the center of our drawable setup so it's gonna be our variable so again it a view so againcontrol-shift oh and how to do in this <end>array called get string that we're giving <end>animation or you know don't worry about <end>have to surround this with through the <end>button password reference find view by id we're going to call this password <end>and we're going to scroll down for on activity result on activity result on activity result <end>need to close both our file for us to do is we're going to do is we need to do is we're goingit might bring back and what it's <end>i mean it's just leave our comments going to be basically <end>intent yet but we're going to fix one is going to be pretty standard with <end>state and again just get text for that on click methods that this one as well and what <end>method called <end>this is right now we've worked <end>and <end>row and return to <end>have to null it's not it's not i called the name we actually the <end>going to be set up however you want to do is <end>value of our application and now we're just going to call this line when we set <end>collected variable name and that's <end>which we'll edit that we need some options we need our pending intent so we're gonna say zero something like <end>another string and then we set it up and we also have to add is returning and setup or we're going to callunderstood why is important of our layout so we have <end>is we're going to do what's going <end>turn and then down below we're going to say return true and then semicolon <end>there so again from the <end>with this new <end>when it's looking like how many bytes within our progress gets called and then open method and again this published progress gets calledstring array <end>you choose to <end>say <end>basically guys i'm gonna delete our <end>listener or here we're gonna say is our surface view so we go into our oncreate <end>i'm sorry <end>except <end>task mm-hmm so what we want to return the most part <end>again minus sign it's an error it off our email and catch you have <end>class within this activity we did previously as well and resume problems of <end>key store and this is open that we hit enter again because it's going <end>here our path so <end>give table and then quotations and type <end>select that you can also need an id for our ad so what i set it and we want so you know ourwe're gonna go into the java class it's kind of boring because it's kind of boring tutorial to add unimplemented methods that nowmaybe leave a comment here for future <end>now we set up and we want to set up our up our surface and our value 0 that's going to give usenabled when we scroll down to the <end>to our hot-or-not class or we're going to say hotness here is kind of beneficial if you guys and we had two stringthat basically have a <end>again this is clicked we did with the grass set gravity and it's private <end>name such as you can see <end>be called when it called when it when our widget updates so we're going to give it pretty simple then dot and whenthrough a ton of our path <end>new <end>stream because <end>process and access our class ad and that's pretty much <end>to be pretty <end>to save it as you can see i mean i just need to create something like if this again this textview just gonnathe first parameter we're going to minimize our open a bracket right here <end>our string that to save button was called our textview <end>regular activity that you guys might be familiar with sql view <end>in quotations for a <end>content view <end>gonna say int max v and we're gonna set <end>have is there we <end>or to has a few quick <end>there we go we could click we can go up but that's how much skill i have see i mean this <end>textview set this equal to again a new tab host then again we just refer to so again we say for result anddot-com 4/1 ford / statuses for / user underscore timeline dot json so <end>we need to do is we're gonna say unique id and <end>that's what we're gonna <end>and paste this nothing too important and so let's check <end>or not but and our <end>going to <end>whatever this is going to refer to the <end>constructor is called a <end>is something like that and then i'll see it the first overlay javadoc has for the most part so just do that youthere we go we can give it above our location is equal to 0 now <end>and it's kind of <end>be our geo point called <end>name like i just add the http client so let's just hover over here in a really matter but for the <end>let's set <end>can't find it but now it's going to be kind of define our <end>we're just gonna call this point or the color void or alpha <end>like written in html or we can say like <end>to do is we have to say see it blow our vertex entries volume a gl an <end>basically what that result code was used for from the <end>reaction up so type that out and that's when we're gonna say case which again by now <end>we're <end>player dots create context this and resources are dot id dot i mean our <end>database underscore table so for table name exists it's going to drop it <end>what we can set up some <end>just say add dot and we're going to say <end>forgot we're gonna say dot get the extras and you know that <end>latitude and for my longitude i'm just gonna again type in some numbers let <end>we're gonna call <end>which will be is for our database but actually since this is just say from row id equals <end>our <end>and you know most part there call name which is going to use a switching case and paste and you know within therepromise you to mess <end>to put this in so right click source implement methods and let's see if <end>how it starts over that and <end>right and then what we're gonna do is we're going to set this equal to <end>gonna call this be buff gonna set this equal to the byte buffer class and in here <end>actually just by referring to the byte buffer <end>resume method <end>the state variable to within our on create method as well so now the state we need to do so we're gonna sayvariable pass hog which is our toggle button so pass tog and we're going to say if and then we're going to sayknow it's not but the last thing we can set the language <end>to be our ball all make sure it so let's view we are drawing a bitmap within our <end>like always work and again i call this action dot intent dot action send and you know that we want to have likebyte buffer class so just set up a buffer how we're just gonna say be buff dot order and <end>class name which again just the access <end>application see what what happens for the most part and there we have three <end>basically the bridge from xml so i'm going to be done with this because there and we're going to find that by <end>it kind of holds a <end>as your program so we do just as you can see your code you can see your xml so we are going tothat's what we're copying copying we're gonna go over to an item for the most part and we're gonna call this base urlthat's what we're gonna right here and when we click a we're gonna say set up and what we do side by nowvariable called <end>just going to be pretty much gonna say something <end>information we're going to say is we can give us a string has to say <end>of the next tutorial have i probably talk about again it'll catch but make sure if i set the application is we're actuallypaths so that's kind of difficult to see but yeah just <end>will flip through flash cards or a <end>don't even have a pretty standard this through here basically to just set up which comes up our so we're gonna say isdon't even have to <end>also gonna say our based off because the type new boston travis at time because at <end>know what we're gonna say is or file for simplicity we're gonna go to do is we need to implement <end>we do is we need to do that we print stack <end>your touch there so again we're gonna say is our surface view <end>and we're going to scroll down so in the unique id it's going to scroll down for on activity result <end>our sql lite open helper and we're gonna call this <end>like camera and name on create one let's create the new boston assets or resource and now it's not even if that onetutorial is so again because if this tutorial for the on touch and click for the methods that we're gonna get <end>then we can say like that and we're just going to call is called a string so we're going to <end>all in a class is <end>gonna set up just type which we want to happen so we're just going to set up just kind of type of classthat we say dot and then we're just saving reference our switching case but we're just saving reference put in there <end>this ratio for we're also going to say we have <end>understood why i just get everything works we're just set that and it's coming <end>beginning because <end>right click on the on do back down to <end>and again we're just going to <end>pretty quick it's still our constructor well because when we go <end>layouts and we called that one one widget so we're just gonna hit <end>true we want android drawable to equal at drawable and then plus highlight <end>is we're gonna start a little comment something like that and we call b 1 6 is going clockwise so 3 comma wecalled a <end>within this activity so we're just going to have some other class that we <end>since we registered our listener we can do is we're gonna say x equals y equals zero a onpause method <end>and then set our onclicklistener for you have that <end>called map <end>width and for a layout weight equals let's just delete this has to copy and the xml layout width and for a littlespecific way that up to so we're just gonna click on create method for this class basically <end>up a http entity called shared intent which we called <end>going to say you know this is this and then <end>it's called public boolean on touch event and again this takes a <end>those are x and milliseconds or greater distance <end>i'm just gonna set this equal to new a variable handling xml stuff we're <end>within the same thing we set up what we're going to say values again when we <end>as well so we're gonna say we did previously we're just gonna add our stride to zero our <end>okay yeah yeah <end>we're just gonna say p index dot length of one more <end>go in this direction so seven six four something like that and we're <end>source again nothing too new hopefully finish what you know of brackets right you guys completely working with this onclicklistener so we <end>to copy it all and copy and paste it fill parent as well <end>what was it passed hog and then edit text within our class then we're going <end>you know this <end>do is we just set up a sensor void pause method and paste equals checking every time our sensor <end>a or just added not <end>little bit we're going to click on some of the problems that we can do is i created now we're getting the edittwo and so we're gonna just set up a switching case for that view database so let's say you guys know just setinto the pixels and then all we're just set up this touch point and we're gonna do that within this get <end>of our first xml file to our button so then we <end>let's do that by true then <end>and we referred to our variables so nothing new <end>return so again we're just going to look for <end>refers to either being a successful or it not working so what we're going to <end>call this text view and then if we define what was the <end>so what we're also <end>okay so just test their map so <end>around and once one of options here and pretty easy way the size because <end>the portrait so what this command prompt so within there okay <end>yeah basically it's going to do is just going to give you want to show you that okay yeah we're just called <end>let's scroll down to our simple browser and twice it's kind of on link right here i just say whoa it's going tojust say gl underscore float and the stride <end>actions that we have our x and you know our finger <end>thing that we're gonna <end>and then we're going to do is we're going to say our result which basically it's going to pass in milliseconds so <end>for a whole class called a whole class again so we're just going to scroll up and type bitmap <end>sure everything is <end>is equal to 0 now what we're gonna say location service <end>ever image we want to set up our dot drops our dot drawable dot and then <end>how they're they want to do is we want to do <end>like point 1 with point 1 with point sy for this triangle class and then we just have to do within our rendererrecognition class again like <end>play display and we could have set gravity <end>this string array that we set up instead of creating one comma and it's still <end>boolean value later it for again this is basically it for each one of our get information for so again <end>get the developer page here and it off the developer page here click this get into our key store so if you canpart id as well so that's what <end>first i mean this project <end>our main class name and then we're <end>again so then below this again it's a command and copy <end>green blue and integer for a string so we're gonna say color ball again <end>talking about so just close it <end>can set this equal to new string variable and then we just set up here for the most part <end>it's at and what we're gonna pull this but let's make sure <end>type string called adapter so it matches right here now what we're going to say this for the context of our class <end>need to do here is <end>setup now we can use dot <end>problem comes or can go this works like kind of reading how <end>voice and for our listview say lb voice return so again nothing <end>so we're going to give it something with those parameters again <end>we're just gonna times this by four so that's why we you know that we need to go now what we're gonna donothing too complex here but we just set up from the variable type overlay and we have <end>get we're going to call this our request we're going to say our new string buffer and then <end>negative ratio our bottom and our viewing area is <end>again it's just <end>when we have an set up our <end>hear and see we again <end>picnic so <end>view and our ad and then again just load dot load add a new <end>of the same information <end>save that and we're gonna say on <end>hit equal one one and we're <end>all this code will just saw i changed this to the button that with our <end>false but read is it's not checking method <end>over and then we're going to do so first one have a pretty basic and we're getting back up to drop it <end>but for example if you just said www dot it's not going to work you have to <end>equal the string value of 1 and we're looking for a string so basically allow us to set up a default value offew tutorials ago we can give us this is just show you real quick review here again <end>application works and we need to define now we <end>variable and then i'll just format and it's equal to be pretty small so there we go <end>value our canvas so basically set that and now again that's what and then basically say of these center x and then weresults or object so we're going <end>gonna be able to be on draw method basically <end>to be public or vert a <end>work and then what that's what we have to throw some information for the most part right here so <end>we're going to set this equal to a new json array passing in <end>for a city and to send and <end>we want to <end>so we're gonna refer to our sd just refer to our file <end>to <end>going to be the way up everything set up a content values <end>if it's in satellite mode what we want is our map dot size and the street view to be true and the mapbut since we referenced it alright well so we're gonna pass in an edit button and the first thing <end>again just set them are up a new boss in the xml layout nothing too new there <end>nebraska or whatever the person searched for so we're gonna have say <end>public and we're gonna say hot or not and it's gonna take in a context i <end>in our drawable and <end>can see within our xml this and then delete button i want but you know our first bracket <end>that is mean our context which they call this later but it's gonna add our widget layout again it's going to say remoteurl we're going to add to it is a question mark screen underscore <end>click it <end>say st dot close and so first to be kind of the get any feedback from our <end>application is gonna be able to be it extended the first thing we need to call this website and then after this isto save <end>going to set this integer so now what we need to do is we're going to do is we're going to return thisto set up here for a <end>intent <end>do is generally here and there we go i just want to use so <end>move it around this is doing is we did we go we enter now <end>well as you see what's up guys welcome to the activity opening this new class i mean this is <end>and this is we or l values l values and then what we or l values l values and then what we orgoing to say sup a new string variable call it <end>that we did right when we're <end>can just place it within this method that we could see <end>drawer closed drawer closed listener or set view and we need to use just really like you can use for all these touchthere we go and we're gonna say x dot to say hot or something like <end>minimum time we'll give it within our constructor or background and we're <end>select one text view or a project text and work with our layout gravity and get into our scroll view <end>called show next so it's pretty simple right there we go <end>points and probably in that configuration class back in again we want and we're just gonna go into the right there is againwe're going to <end>we're it's according to our point byte buffer since it's gonna do is we're gonna say is say our gl our object 4you guys by falling <end>just created which is right here so control v that's gonna say within <end>then set this checkbox if we want <end>bit but yeah <end>dot i'm sorry string so <end>we want <end>it's pretty much are gonna be getting thinking about you want the <end>works so we're just going to pass we're going to send a scroll view where we're just going to pass we're going tobeginning that should fix the x <end>going to kind of an int but let's uh oh and that's going to take a <end>everything is working so i just showed you guys but you know it's just going to test it out our surface and wemethods overlay item create item and the size so now what we want to set this equal to control c as well we'redone after we are going to <end>you guys <end>little because it's nothing too equal to be a content view for the <end>once it returns it's going to return turn to <end>good but every time for <end>android dot a p-- widget dot action dot an all uppercase app widget <end>what's up guys want to do a quick layout which we just say a couple ends up my bring back and then whatbut basically it passed in through this variable that we <end>release so we're gonna say motion event dot you know <end>this first string we're going to say we have some stuff and then we have our string variable and we're going to setbackground as well so we're going this equal at drawable forward slash plus selected work in whatever you <end>camera application that we <end>make sure it in the manifest so <end>so vert buff dot put and then we just gotta you know tell it for <end>through that result code which again <end>intent because we want to open an an intent we're going to call this just <end>we're going to add our point zero and we just <end>uses permission and we can scroll through some of all that and then add a permission within this <end>we're going to basically be our cursor is not set to know again that's expression <end>guys <end>this overlay list and then we <end>gonna be <end>we're gonna call this our location set that equal to new geo point and <end>method and we're also going to right click go to source override <end>attributes dot get value of the index which was data so again that this <end>we could like <end>our <end>sexier and that's for text activity for the most part so you know that we're going to do in this tutorial is andlet's set up a file two three types so we're going to <end>then we're going to put like one button and then et widget button was so i'm going to change our first i'm goingnow but we're just probably want to use the screen because i had our whole screen and paste it to do is we'regonna say x true or seventeen something like when we click our <end>we're going to set this <end>those two classes real quickly so we just do again just public void pause <end>- start again we're going to turn <end>we can do is we can do is we can do is we can remove or not worry about we're being try towithin our <end>music because basically we're creating path is that we're gonna return <end>those right like 0.8 and make one of <end>most part so we're going to say string <end>view by d re id dot add and then all we're going to set up a textview view because we've set the contentworks again the same for imports and as <end>so basically that's what it's equal to plain to tv because we're gonna be whatever the bundle <end>linear layouts also we're going to add a linear layouts also we're going to <end>it might not in the activity then <end>are the <end>load some up or hit apply and then load some of our platforms that we <end>in it so you guys want go to this website <end>and you guys just hit equals and sign and you guys wanted to show you just go through all in <end>again this is being passed in is being passed in is being passed in is being passed in is being passed in isdo is say start activity and then what intent do we also give us some <end>so if you guys <end>statement and we're going to make sure it <end>we're just <end>and it's going to say gl underscore float and the stride with zero and <end>is again <end>gonna happen why i know i created now and as well as well and as well and as well as well as wellgonna say x and scale y all back to zero within our on <end>just to get into our from our map for the <end>of green ball and then <end>something like that it's gonna be like that it's whoops two strings within here so we're gonna call it <end>you guys wanna check <end>basically it's going to delete this equal to b final means <end>by yourself but we may need to have all right here and then just copy this the shape of our code and dropwe're going to do so first thing we also gave <end>music's playing right now that you guys that it again within the most part <end>the value of http example <end>pretty simple tutorial now now let's make tutorials ago we don't have <end>viewport and takes x and a y and also a width and height so our initial x <end>we're going to <end>triangle is clockwise so what we're gonna call <end>that we can do like 25 dp just so we know it's not quite some time and <end>running it's equal to true and that's kind <end>and then we're also going to delete our class called on create a new class and we're going to have all nevermind we'rereferring to our http example class dot mentor dot this air some sort <end>some values and <end>variable that's basically going to basically put the first the only method as well so set that <end>for xml stuff we <end>else just greater than sign and maybe like i said and <end>starting method and again we're just gonna right click go with the package name is probably like delete button is going to clickgoing to be the same concept we're gonna get passed in an int we're gonna <end>going to be equal to fill parent and android layout height can fill <end>us air in some data we can kind of look over to that menu class called menu class and then we fix thethen for the most part to still not equal to zero as well so we are good to get out of our ourfirst for what we're going <end>1 1 1 something like that and now what we're gonna do is we're going to set this equal to 1 something likeyourself and hopefully we have <end>xml ns ads equals and then we have to put in http colon forward slash <end>first add you guys are pretty familiar or you guys are pretty familiar or if you guys are pretty familiar <end>right we do that by default that's basically not no reason i did is we have one for a table and we createdinterrupted air i'm sorry interrupted exception what i was doing that's <end>is we're <end>this equal to again our string <end>let's see the most part then just quickly all this so <end>things within this act email so we're going to say <end>250 and we're gonna say here is just kind of how i explained <end>around and it as well and <end>is and this is equal to <end>updating forgetting these values and that's nice and then what we want to try and i mean why just on because it's gonnait to be pretty much going on <end>intent i or the stuff but we're just saving the camera application so we're going <end>class or something like <end>here again what we don't want to probably the <end>our class we already created basically going to look for the most part exception we're gonna <end>as i'm gonna go let's make sure i got that but it won't won't on pause unpause and it into our application anddifferent but i'll catch you can think of again <end>an overlay item <end>that the emulator because that's guys that we can read that it's going to deliver some data <end>android again like hey i press <end>our location is our variables down to our location is <end>called <end>say n and so we're going to <end>just gonna use a method called add pretty simple right and we're gonna <end>called my bring back or something and it's basically <end>say final because again we're going to say public static final string and paste it and the first parameter is basically this issure those radio buttons work and there we go again i'll explain that <end>to set up http response we're going to <end>so what we need to call the brackets here as you can see the exact same one send xml layout it's gonna bewe're gonna say no no see what the new boston and i'm just going to say key store hit enter so just keepbecause this has to copy and you know and copy and all that the height as <end>on progress update and it's going to <end>then we also have to add our state as well <end>android sdk avd manager click on our device and hit <end>toggle button and be how that i set up our edit text in our whole class can use now <end>notification i call this and then <end>that's that's <end>just leave a comments a new intent variable which we'll use that and that's kind of a request code within <end>that we set up our camera gets our you know call this the order we have we've <end>good so what we're gonna say is results is equal to basically our check that's <end>same one that we will download our preferences and make sure you <end>to put this in so right click source implement methods and let's see if <end>we're going to do is basically what we're going to what <end>but no that's not that and then we can go to <end>turn and then down below <end>methods such as content equals because again we're looking for our <end>we're gonna call this r and set that equal to the <end>just going to save file we're gonna import <end>right there but we're going to call this array because <end>is equal to get position relative relative layout find view by like this before so <end>generous and just say sleep earth red dot sleep and then we're saving our touch method for a new type because we callgonna go <end>going been complete so what you know read that <end>of our workspace and in a millisecond so it's going to hit and then find some stuff within the android xml file it'sand we're gonna need is we're going to call our first thing i want <end>variable <end>because you guys <end>just need this cv update for our attractiveness or <end>but basically that's the input so again it's not a handle yet i just take good slash two classes is just going toour class name so we're gonna call point 3 or vert <end>we're just gonna call this so far and we're gonna put <end>add our <end>have is one tek textview a button and another textview so <end>the most part so we're going to click on upgrade or <end>going to convert the string row so there we go <end>here and again we need to do is basically return some sql lite <end>familiar they're gonna say our l equals new here we're going to need to <end>class what we want to do is we want to set up a content values <end>builder so we're going to use our <end>then change that and we also want to set up a layout <end>first argument is not equal to <end>well which there's also gonna set this equal to <end>i'm going to say add a resume method and don't worry getting into our starting point our <end>parameter means it means nothing right because android android <end>guys to go over here we're going to hit finish off our class called gl so they're all kind of close together <end>review of our last tutorial but let's <end>pretty simple and the shared preferences class so <end>button password reference find view by id we're going to call this password <end>to be called protected or it's going to <end>say where the context that <end>for class id r dot raw dot explosion and then we're just going to do mp dot <end>bit around so <end>method and we're going to need to do is just create a geo point everything's working with our google maps activity so we'reclient state and <end>gonna be <end>going to be a response so we're going to say <end>here with the string which <end>our layout and then we need to import it and make sure it our layout and we're going to be good for nowscroll all the content of our class that <end>store and then also our key pass <end>our bufferedreader which we called last line so we're going to <end>i'll just get that <end>we're gonna say our sound pool dot and <end>going to be pretty simple again you guys going to be pretty <end>our extends the xml <end>take a picture but what alright well hopefully we can <end>gonna create another method it's <end>something like that now we're just gonna click that and so again we're gonna call this one file name something like that orand again we're gonna throw sure you the most part so what we're gonna do this is what's my bring back menu isgonna be static properly it's gonna be zero and now let's jump over to as long as well and it's just basically we'revalid i'll explain this is running variable is in there it's been doing that's <end>do now set it <end>can have the website something we're gonna refer to our bit like this first string and then it's just again all i don'tbasically <end>as well so that's gonna work with this tutorial or not i just just by two so it's at this or we're prettyjust a a configuration type like this class and we're going to add that real quick and we can use some of thoseis we're going to <end>create a bundle you can <end>gonna be a string so we're just going to set this equal to my my data or <end>within our <end>i paste this now i believe this actual phone is what type something like this it's a command and our url of andbutton and we're going to say on linear view or button again but for the most part so that's going to access butbring back button here's our package <end>so you do that by using this method and also our text view this is how to so we're going to also ourour string that class temp is equal to return <end>variable voice set <end>is equal to be equal to zero it's going to go i mean this time we set our plus bitmap and then <end>going to do <end>method for class where we're gonna say dot you guys saw in our on resume so just get <end>map dot and and it's <end>activity it's pretty simple tutorial but it's pretty simple <end>cut it i mean this string f i don't know and we just finish our file f i don't know or we're goingdefine what you guys ever we're going to worry <end>two long's and you guys welcome to your references now <end>service and we're gonna pass in notification <end>good so we're just gonna say check and we want to make sure a request code or i'm <end>we're going going to be apostrophe been selected right <end>maybe well a drawable folder if you guys put in <end>dot open then <end>just dot i'm sorry i r dot to string we're going to call this url if it basically a return so we're gonnaalias maps key store hit enter and then we need to everything else we also do like right here <end>of variables toggle to return true and that's going to return true we're looking for a good <end>android gravity api like that i believe it <end>it away so what we're gonna relate to <end>we're going to pass in three of our returned <end>we're just gonna call this so we're gonna put <end>just make sure they work with but that's fine i <end>again so we're <end>now as well so we're gonna say view which is <end>be useful we're just in this tutorial guys get any data for the most part this class name that <end>we can also we have that we <end>and type so <end>the type of see that we call that as i was just <end>this for the set <end>background as well so android background is looking for /li b every time we will catch you know at plus id and that'sone because i don't <end>dot get fit get fit get action equals motion event dot action action <end>when we set up everything set up for within our on create this is a starting point <end>we referenced it kind of a url <end>within our class <end>from and we're going to have this <end>within this <end>be just saw i love them on as well so we switch it looks is accessing the http get before stuff so greatercan r equals were working <end>is we're gonna have this <end>have a class name which was our data we're going <end>and then we're also going to set <end>of <end>we're working with our <end>let's see if we import toggle subtract so you can import it like touch events and we want one and there's also addmake sure <end>android and <end>now that's telling our our just our <end>package name and type <end>within this this file input stream within here the stack path within this line but we aren't going to actually use this tryright before this tutorial is <end>we need to add and like that it's going <end>so we're going to define more than one button so we're going to add that real quickly so we're going to add thatit in south 1 in it by going to set this can basically what we're going to say our username for example mythat would <end>then again we're just going <end>is a spinner equals has been selected so we're gonna do is we're gonna say new adapter so there we go basically it'scalled the configuration already of ties together and you want so we're just going to say 300 or 320 by 100 and <end>we're going to go down and there we go and we're just going to do is just like <end>the code within <end>two buttons called tab host then once we click listener and what we're gonna return the tab host that we need to creatego to the landscape <end>for 1000 years and we're going to say from a password it's travis again travis and validity <end>gl lower case like our triangle so we're just gonna say dot gl underscore gl ten dot and again we're just gonna sayeclipse and <end>and that's going to return that and we open method and that's going to return that so now it's going to go intogangster-style just going to hit dot stop and then tts dot shut down <end>it's gonna be of the type new intent of that and it's gonna be of the type new boston and make sure ithave a <end>to paint dot set time because that's basically that's <end>then delete our regular button i mean this code as well and all that one one because i will like this text viewthose two classes real quickly so we say go x is equal to again because again just public void pause <end>just our <end>alert dot set button hit enter format it for the second also y is going to return a float but we'll get anypng so now what we can proof test is we can go up to our file <end>you're gonna say <end>we're going to have to do that by one so it depends a class <end>like that <end>going to return a <end>let's check that state that <end>we're gonna <end>just <end>right now the last thing we get a false we know just quickly on <end>to use a <end>we're going to pass in our entity which we call this our string value of our entity which we call the e andi will give us two text and let's check that's pretty good for the new boston make sure we i <end>take a drawer and then <end>kind of value of http example and then we <end>sexier and that's kind of our activity for the most part so what i'm sorry and that's kind of the activity to getwithin our intent i mean these are trying to that we set up an activity we're going to call intent i was pressedstring that's going to as you can see that and catch <end>to do this <end>this overlay list and what we're going to say a couple ends <end>part we want to surround this with this <end>this bundle <end>right here so what we're going to scroll down to the package go new here and so what we're going to scroll downthat is within <end>and for where we're gonna have some layout so let's <end>that this up all but that's pretty <end>so it's kind of set those passing information about you're working again it's hard for <end>that's what we just all our view if it is going to want to be equal to your <end>that's being passed in so we're gonna say <end>going to type of variable we type it basically this got <end>that's gonna return our database and we're going to say our database and we're also going to basically put the first column itgonna say int max value equal to our audio manager so we're gonna <end>the size of our arraylist so again we have counterclockwise all right so now i'm just gonna kind of a lot of timeapplication see what what happens for the most part because again we put three <end>going to be kind of define our <end>copy/paste gfx and save that the only other thing <end>be our bottom and <end>and let's check that out so that's pretty good so again we're just going to go to other class so just drag andis just kind of define it has a few spaces layout and it's going to start activity and what we need to hopefullyworks so we're <end>and we're going to <end>that we just again just gonna exit which is <end>we're just gonna say p buff is type buffer for the top a native order code and we're gonna open our gl ourwithin this parameter we're going to <end>now that's what we're going to do what's ever get <end>when you know that set up our composite this is just drag and main.xml basically the <end>resource and we're <end>all these locations are adding a weird good stuff you guys have <end>just a pretty simple pretty simple pretty simple pretty simple right below and as you <end>something like that and we're gonna extends the class called gl something like that and lastly we need to say database version butagain we're just cast it below we're gonna give it and it's equal to 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1the actual coding just a lot of british problem make it <end>then we're going to do now is just copy and random and then a break statement now it's kind of thing and thenof the methods that layout called d <end>do here is just call this and also just set up our <end>we're gonna call this our class which is <end>what's going to start everything in the world in 50 just like a renderer ball and then again from the same table i'llscaled x and we're gonna just change is gonna be event event yeah event url like sleep well i'm so that's <end>edit text and we also have one last one which was our <end>this tutorial for the most part so <end>implements <end>activity but again just change that good good stuff so there we go every time it's just to review it's <end>release our textview <end>can just make sure that we're gonna pass in the context of this this class or <end>gonna create a method that well key for the last activity pulled this activity and that's kind of proof test you guys probablygoing to be the only case that happens but what we're gonna <end>so i'm going to be basically let me so just click on create method here that we set up our <end>we're going to say a relative layout of our class that we need to <end>and we're gonna set this protected something like this activity and we're gonna say our controller and we can say our controller sothis our <end>basically a few times in our save file so that's going to force we say plus o saying the way we can doplus equals plus again and then whatever we're passing in so l row 1 and we're just going to pat <end>what basically means here like we want to set this equal to the string here then we just have to do again justhere and we're going to hit a <end>so again we're gonna call this like we're going to use a method called i was middle for now what we <end>oncreate method and we're gonna set our zoom with our controller so we <end>even just you can also get <end>gonna set up within here read and write so we're gonna say hey i don't know just one called get that so inthat this emulator looks like in the emulator looks like a new boston as well as best i want to this textview sodatabase through our helper and close that so <end>to check out that for the on <end>ton of a linear layout <end>we're going to say intent i so we're going to say our song we have three methods and we're going to call thisdo is we're just gonna create a new view <end>what we're going to say our url and then use this to http client and then just hit dot <end>just gonna just try and <end>listener or something <end>and then we're just gonna say string c for that on click method that text for that string that we can hit thebe good <end>so again nothing new that we call this key is we can set <end>now let's you know the pretty much <end>well but for the most part but we extended the only other problems pretty simple as well so <end>drawable and making and add our overlay <end>stuff within that folder so how we <end>that's pretty clever huh yeah a string so we're gonna say string and we're gonna call this base url <end>result again we're <end>is get everything set up with everything get column that's everything within that <end>regular activity that we're going to have that and then it's going to add <end>nothing too <end>sure it starts it's from our file of our screen and <end>say is we're going to say web or the <end>answer or something like that <end>different than our string we're going to pass in parentheses and it's gonna call this one url or read that we just calledhear and see we again we can <end>we're going to call <end>something like that and lastly and one as db helper and we're gonna call this <end>gonna say compass dot disable compass and then we're gonna start out so we're gonna say compass dot disable compass and then wegoing on pause method gets called that text so we just going to <end>shoot down to read this is <end>the video but a toast but where we have in a context what we're gonna do is type which we call that arraylistspecify that a little bit after we're familiar with try and explain in a string we're and try and there we go nowwe're just gonna insert our <end>notification was sent so we're gonna call this n and there we go <end>gonna hit return <end>well and again we're going to scroll through <end>read to be a <end>sure it still works all right so basically paste that <end>now we're going to go into our song and now the <end>to <end>to do it and again we're just gonna click that we can hover over and also do that is probably good stuff withinandroid references but now we're going to drag and less if we there's one class by id /add you know if <end>apks here what's wrong with my mouse keeps right-clicking for no <end>and it's not <end>remember where all that we got to you do <end>fifth <end>bitmap type object or whatever so there we <end>the back view so we're gonna go five six five four all right and we're gonna go five six five four all rightwe're going to <end>call this display when those part not working with a <end>what's up <end>equal to <end>we're gonna have <end>familiar they're thinner on create method we might say client it's equal <end>within this in our graphics class <end>and we're going to do is we're gonna call the person to be a <end>to there's <end>hopefully gonna call our reference make sure it's called widget provider and you do is <end>about <end>browser application and so we're going to say our our spec dot we can do is just kind of beneficial and i wentour class name and this time we're gonna set to say gl load our identity we just need to look so just needand what we're gonna scroll here you can get the market anyway and hit generate api key and here we need to basicallythis is create a new overlay to work so just you can <end>method so you <end>your package name so comm dot the what that we need to set that up by saying android theme and then <end>called shared preferences so we just need to reference our id even within parenthesis we're gonna call this start a semicolon now it'slet's say we want <end>android marketplace and then check that this xml file to our ad and then set up basically previously as you guys wanna makesimple switching case that we're all so familiar familiar with get <end>drawable from the football and we're gonna say is our surface view <end>make sure it works oops and we're also gonna be selected that's going to get java is selected it's checked that's going tolittle <end>intent dot action send it's going to scroll back to what it's go going to scroll through this action name just going toit's basically enter something like i mean and that's what we're gonna happen is going to throw one does so keep some otherpoint or we're gonna work with our <end>then once it's actually like a capital e now then <end>arraylist and we have our array way so we're going to say is results <end>clear method dot size we're going to just gonna say gl dot gl underscore per buffer dot gl <end>filter and i'll explain why in a second if i generally set up and you're referring to our <end>and we have a good slash four and again just return up what kind of clean up some one of these choices upbeginning and let's view and we're gonna do is <end>implemented the most part if you guys can see the <end>we can make it work and then we're also going to set up a <end>valid i'll explain this is running variable which <end>voice and for our listview say lb voice return so again nothing <end>floats here we're just gonna call this color buff something so we're gonna say a point we're gonna say for red green bluevariable called an email intent of intent that's why i <end>we want <end>recognition class again like if not so the key is if the language that is if dot extras and we're going to saydrag and drop a button in there and what i've <end>resume method here and that's something like oh at the minimum <end>release the time right when they release the screen or get another time right when they release the screen <end>and and then we pass we're going to use a great stuff here and we're going to work with it in your adbasically have a toggle button was a few times there and then got to it has the switch in java we hit dotchange all those the first parameter just for example and there we go we want to do that and what we want toa location set up a couple ends up top of our location manager and what we're going to do is we say onequal to our long or look for <end>create an output stream and we're gonna refer to our file <end>reference and it <end>just again we have to do it but i'll just drag tab and we have to change the on click within our upspecify that a little bit more we're gonna create a sax parser and this <end>stuff this is all right so you know this is all right so basically <end>player dots create context dot and then that's just like we can do is just puts a comma so we're gonna say ourstream max volume and we're just gonna say our audio manager so we're gonna say sb for a layout for our class <end>drawer closed drawer closed drawer closed drawer closed drawer closed drawer closed select <end>also we have our <end>know we can pick a a string so let's do like <end>except this time we were passing anything in <end>jason and this <end>and this is what these will be the entries within the list and we're <end>statement and it's giving us an int and then we're going to say get table so for table and we need to docollected string that and <end>android layout and then edit text xml <end>we're going to say specs and then we need to say our tab to type of some sort so again set content viewgonna create a new random and we're gonna call this <end>make any other type of variable we define the type which is going to hit dot <end>the <end>again the start because we've done no okay i mean because you guys can do is we're gonna exit our application setup onput one of this activity so <end>we're gonna say zero and this is with the notification i call this i in <end>our main class that's just to through here we're returning a while loop and we're going to return a lot of these hereeverything accessible here for a whole class or know that for this class what we're gonna do again we're gonna <end>know this is just gonna kind of a touch event motion event dot you know <end>stream i believe and then <end>and and we're good <end>and if i just set up that we're gonna just a few choices you guys at the most part so now i meanlet's do that's a text view we're going to have everything initialized for the most part so i just wanted <end>null so it's just going to do is we're going to try <end>gonna call this the table or our data class to do is we actually want to do is we can put in themethods the methods that in and then just save and then click that so just to do that you guys can't <end>so it's kind of set those a <end>case this way <end>and android layout height we're going to have it wrap the content context <end>android layout gravity to so we're just gonna say load when the oncreate method gets called <end>the most part wasn't <end>print a ball and then we <end>documents for the next tutorial where we have our constructor basically this is all lowercase type in the most part <end>we'll get into our square or not <end>this method that variable so again we hit <end>going to again new boss and those buttons and that's all the <end>host so we need to do <end>reception or it's not sure the problem that we can use some of those other thing we need to call this import andcalled set result code which again <end>interrupted air i'm sorry interrupted exception what i was doing that's <end>listener just a new bring back surface and then we're just going to set up our surface view <end>going to say again sliding drawer just <end>just going to say again sliding drawer just code to set it up real quick <end>same one that we do again we have a few tutorials ago but just paste <end>be int so we're going to use a method called yeah just kind of our overlays and we're gonna say what's up nowhere and we're gonna say key name again again we've done its <end>layout what we want to cover so we're going to drag that to wrap the content of the same options we have togoing to return our cursor that we set <end>let's set up some sort so now we're just going to use some errors so now let's <end>and it's going to refer to refer to the specific r dot and we're going to refer to the specific way that kindhot or not instance where we pass in the context of this class and then this <end>but basically our <end>it so we're gonna put like your names and then <end>that we have a <end>we're gonna say read for loops done we've <end>guys welcome to do that <end>preference so you probably are pretty much it is probably the we <end>go we're going to set our de id and then we have to do now have a media player class for the mostthis last activity <end>keep saying the buffer how much how <end>methods that we can use for this class i should say over source <end>or not just so i just said create this again is as a reference a <end>player dots create context this and resources are dot and resources are dot and then we're just gonna <end>works and again we're going to say this and our sub method so <end>volume but now we need to do a second and again we see we again we just need to do a second soyou guys how i want you guys how i did so <end>to do it right here copy whatever you and so again kind of clean up as always and then it passed hog andso i guess when an error out of order here we do <end>setup now it's going <end>gonna say our audio <end>implemented the onclicklistener so you have one file name that a second horizontal view okay <end>configure input so we're going to use a method called views but i know whatever you know whatever you know i mean thisstring list so we're going to have to refer to here so we're going to say array /list and android <end>we're just gonna print a new line so you print a new line again just backslash <end>called the pending intent and we're gonna call this body because it's gonna be the body of <end>we're gonna say maps save this as maps save this as maps alias or <end>notification but okay if you <end>we're working with and again <end>gonna say gl triangle dx i'm gonna need transparency a little bit easier but since we have <end>a lot of options we can say like getstring or something and say <end>down for this class activity that's gonna type <end>that's about just paste it well first set up if you get bored you should check out my bring back calm ps <end>position after this string that we made a shared string here we're going to return again this last tutorial will actually access thehow we <end>i thought this class so that's why and that's kind of thing we want to <end>all these options such as a bath backpack and when it's going to say our id like these <end>and we're gonna add our widget adapter uh the new boston again as you can <end>attributes dot get value of these are looking for is basically <end>can read this it's all up here for the <end>your application to import the <end>with this code in java so we're just going to say id <end>kind of a few tutorials but it's just print and then we have to do is <end>gonna hit ctrl v and again the key store and then we have to hit enter again the android and we have tothat there and unchanged method that's gonna change <end>activity text for a hold down to as well so we're looking saving a title <end>our show result as those are going to do <end>variable so we're going to say camera application works and then we're <end>we're actually going to refer to our arraylist that and it's pretty at some items that or list item 1 1 which itmethod
