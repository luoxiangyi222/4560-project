4,8_59/00121.jpg,real quickly and this one's going to be public so other classes can us,like 0.85 something more you know we can do is we even now and we establish what we don't worry about the to
71,8_58/00244.jpg,to b 0 now what we can do is instead of having this 0 here we can put i,copy this is just gangsta and you know kind of a resource folder maybe one we're also going to do for the 
110,8_70/00255.jpg,save that and run it now and you know this is going to be our firs,according to the actual you can get into the assets from that we can refer to the actual you probably just do somethin
173,8_193/00036.jpg,one more tutorial before we actually get into the way that you guys want to d,group of probably confusing for now but basically it's within our slider class as you can also you know pretty quick make sur
233,8_193/00340.jpg,one prefs right here all upcase and then all we have to do is set u,dot travis dot travis dot travis and then one and then we got reference so we're just going to just basically the typ
240,8_193/00354.jpg,set up that we created for the most part so i'm going to copy one o,uppercase so starting point starting to lose my voice i'm sorry style one to start first title so we're going to do <end
293,8_187/00196.jpg,bring back surface class just to do something a little different i',going to kind of give the to create two so you're going to read through every time you guys want to do wit
334,8_150/00131.jpg,second parameter it's our actual bitmap that won't want to decode so we'r,surface and then what we already within our on pause method we can just copy this will get rid of that we creat
355,8_150/00188.jpg,now within the way this application setup but i just want to show yo,so there we go to this actually guys have an ide which all this tutorial i should know it down here the cod
382,8_144/00047.jpg,know we can pick a color from here so let's do lik,save and we're just setting it equal to the you know the bottom or a bitmap we're going to be here and androi
397,8_144/00168.jpg,bitmap and then we have some different parameters as you can see we're goin,center y is the top where we were just say just canvas dot draw random and then what what we were just t
453,8_178/00058.jpg,string line for l or l for line and we're just going to set this als,return a method execute and and we have you know this is we want to add to type in our bufferedreader that's goin
483,8_178/00125.jpg,value that we're reading so we're going to say our line plus we want to ad,then we just specified a little bit further by a little bit further by a little bit further you guys want to us
561,8_178/00327.jpg,sort of air as well just always good to keep that in mind of how ou,view so that's just so there so now what we can refer to it everywhere else so we're just gonna say our 
586,8_123/00024.jpg,for the get method using the http client we'll get into again that twitte,is a java we can contact you know our xml parsing class as well then just save it into the tutorial i jus
610,8_123/00108.jpg,that or before that as well this is where we're going to use our setting,our edit text in there for the most important one and we're going to do is we just have one so again jus
658,8_123/00224.jpg,for the most part so we want that to be true as well instead of if we set i,client it's not and then what we're going to do now it's do is create object that's just do now are enable els
663,8_123/00261.jpg,sure everything works and that's pretty much it for this tutorial guy,let's change and since we click on resume method for the emulator it's going to put a capital l as so <end
686,8_17/00123.jpg,something called array list and that's what this is going to refer to s,so let's set up like 200 now let's go to be good good stuff but you'll show you guys don't know set u
851,8_136/00110.jpg,which notification we want to set up so we're just gonna say unique id an,though we're gonna type it a little activity there is again is for a way we have to notify the user has on
856,8_136/00115.jpg,need an unique id is well actually i'll show you but we're gonna copy thi,looks like we've used a terrible is a little activity there we go we've done we've set up a new works all yo
899,8_122/00148.jpg,say within our on click method after w,example and that's what we need to type it looks kind of understand what that's what we need at least i all w
900,8_122/00149.jpg,say within our on click method after w,know me travis and there we go we've done that you know showing and then it you know add all we have t
965,8_122/00328.jpg,know how to do this as well so we're going to say button because we hav,this to the top there and takes flags and we're going to say view flipper we're going to can access this some differen
1047,8_134/00212.jpg,activity and kind of made these reference bridges over from the xm,we're going to set them up guys welcome to your own at another bracket below the button so we're going to have thi
1066,8_120/00035.jpg,say string and we're gonna call this city set this equal to null so no,what we're going to quickly just kind of those four and i'm not much the next tutorial i and i'm <end
1086,8_120/00145.jpg,like this yet but also we're gonna say public void set temp and agai,that's going to copy this and we're gonna hit that time instead of creating this for the most part and that's the sam
1090,8_120/00152.jpg,going to be the same concept we're gonna get passed in an int we're gonn,class and that's being passed in and after we set this result to try to be a string or whatever was the curso
1096,8_120/00167.jpg,equal to be whatever is being passed in is t so now again we have a metho,again we're gonna set this equal to basically where this is basically the string and we're going to <end
1106,8_120/00187.jpg,our textview so it needs to be a string we're just gonna say data t,int and it's going to copy this equal to basically our expression class and then we just cuz oops and the the mos
1131,8_120/00237.jpg,space degrees actually so i just thought i'd show you guys this before we ge,know these variables and that's gonna say our string and then our cursor dot and what we're just gonna say our string an
1156,8_120/00312.jpg,we're getting passed in so what we're gonna do is we're gonna sa,all of our database and for the most part and all we have to again we're going to learn is equal to whateve
1185,8_108/00089.jpg,just gonna scroll up to where we said get data before because this is kin,that's going to initially set it start at the value of our database and the database for the first parameter yeah we hav
1189,8_108/00096.jpg,our name is our second column that's position 1 and this is positioned to,position after the last row four index array up here a new string the database and then it's going to add a ne
1190,8_108/00103.jpg,if we're returning our name we can also just say if we know which column i,that's our cursor is at the index row 1 and then we're going to set this equal to result and we're going t
1193,8_108/00106.jpg,our cursor is set to null it's just going to return a null so it',going to pass in our database and we're going to create another method here we can catch you know our database and we'r
1309,8_28/00140.jpg,need to create three buttons are three basically uh images and add it t,but yeah fullscreen so here is basically we're going to read through some graphics aren't following for us sorry but again we ge
1316,8_28/00148.jpg,so we're going to do is we're going to say custom button right in her,reference this package name basically this package name so you know add that again set up this is gonna right here so we'r
1327,8_28/00175.jpg,choose that within this option here and then hit finish and it shoul,want you to show you guys how we can find and scroll down here in you don't open up our orientation we're goin
1370,8_14/00209.jpg,again it's an xml file within our drawable folder but that's fine no,other but since we briefly talked on top one other one that we briefly talked on top of a tutorial we had thi
1423,8_14/00410.jpg,activity i think or the whole application i should say so agai,so what is just right-click from the start activity to keep track of this activity result and basically our start activity result an
1462,8_15/00107.jpg,then we just have to import that and implement the method from the ma,be pretty quick example of that and to keep track of that our controller or it's just for this on location listener lik
1566,8_15/00370.jpg,so there we go um now we have this magic magi,it's centering basically when they only two buttons so to the left of there that would just the left you do is we'r
1651,8_29/00264.jpg,the new boston as well and then we have a resource folder and here',then we have this up but basically type what java jdk i'm going to do is type on windows and the android folde
1652,8_29/00265.jpg,drawable that's where we're going to drag and drop this image int,but as new other tutorial for the new yet so this tutorials ago we take a lot of our starting point so th
1655,8_29/00272.jpg,into our rar folder again if you guys don't have a ra,to basically start again this point one two or whatever you guys welcome to your windows one is your setup so you guy
1678,8_109/00030.jpg,go to other and then under this android folder again we're going t,call the other time you guys to go over to our menu as you just been following in this tutorial is within <end
1680,8_109/00033.jpg,android xml to setup a new layout we hit next and then we have a we have t,then at least two so just copy and we're going to add a good and that's basically basically just basically just drag an
1704,8_109/00093.jpg,the p&amp;g or the extension you're going to get an air as well so you don't wan,show you guys were probably pretty easy for the new class we're going to do is set up so there we go that'
1769,8_109/00308.jpg,use this blue that they have set up and there we go pretty muc,accessible to be color or the default basically the code so it's private void and let's get rid of the code but els
1771,8_109/00313.jpg,you guys simple stuff for the most part i just wanted to show you guy,text play display your total is space here hit this two within this tutorial i just created it's set this where's dot se
1777,8_109/00325.jpg,and we're first gonna do is kind of talk about some of these parameters tha,called random and so there we go every time this you know numbers that we have this didn't want to do that i
1801,8_109/00384.jpg,less than n which is you know the length less than n which is you know th,to create toast and display a toast that's short and also have like a toast make text and and also have to d
1820,8_109/00429.jpg,say context because again we're getting passed into context we're just goin,gonna do is say int ran random position so there we go every time this you know numbers that we have a goo
1843,8_121/00238.jpg,of a concept where you can't understand what's goin,to create a the emulator but since we're gonna hit dot and an update on pause method and a toast so <end
1887,8_135/00127.jpg,the new bossin and it looks like it looks lik,to change the stars and you know if i forgot we're gonna gonna hit dot and then we set this up to thin
1890,8_135/00152.jpg,those guidelines properly but i'm just gonna change that real quick withi,want to show you guys in the next tutorial i don't know you know hit dot and it's gonna kind of set <end
1975,8_119/00049.jpg,result we need to import that method basically on activity results s,dot set this key and we're going to do again whenever this class again you can see this is going to refer t
2025,8_119/00195.jpg,textview fine view by d r dot id dot tv show results or whatever you guy,and then just hit new text-to-speech and we're going to do it has the on click method to send view and so agai
2074,8_131/00159.jpg,set up a new type of variable along result and this is going to be equa,say our milliseconds so we're just going to set up a a slider because that's going to do is we have some sor
2083,8_131/00174.jpg,took the person to go from start to stop and then we're going to say ou,so i'm sorry right here so i'm sorry right here so you can see it didn't that problem real quickly hopefully when w
2097,8_131/00205.jpg,and we're done i mean basically all we did is we got the current time a,so there we go so control yeah we're also going to set up a pretty simple now basically that maybe yeah we're gonn
2148,8_125/00167.jpg,you tell me what to do and then that's what we set up within our o,this one as well as for this second points again the gl 10 class and we unlocked our on draw our <end
2155,8_125/00207.jpg,this clear command and how we do that is again i don't know what that symbo,performance and also we have three choices that good stuff so we're just gonna start everything else we need to change this righ
2283,8_39/00139.jpg,config and we're gonna have our edit text also just be et widge,it's not for both of our sliding drawer and let's check this out everything's looking pretty good <end
2289,8_39/00151.jpg,need to set up our actual widget so this is the widget xml file all we'r,underscore folder if i don't get into the open view class here we go over the tutorial is just a activity make o
2351,8_38/00037.jpg,"power but for 330 minutes we're gonna say 180,000 seconds or millisecond",dot the new boston dot travis dot travis and our configuration going to be every year roughly every that this widget underscore confi
2363,8_38/00074.jpg,it's not that great but you can go into more detail there so i'll catch yo,gonna get into the xml layout with some of those four basically what's so this layout these classes that by right-clicking on <end
2366,8_38/00084.jpg,we're still going to be working with our google maps activity what we're goin,this in last point the location so we're gonna go you know we'll get longitude i'm going to help you need to creat
2390,8_38/00145.jpg,dot get y and both those are returning floats and again this is an intege,you know an error because the second for the most part that's greater than like action is even leave a comment because th
2414,8_38/00198.jpg,button because we're gonna basically display the address so we're gonn,which we can also do is we're going to set up our geo underscore pinpoint and just to set as it's a custo
2419,8_38/00227.jpg,that and then a delete the type there and paste it above as well so now w,controller object that's gonna be pretty much all those text and we're gonna call this controller is going to be it's gonna typ
2421,8_38/00240.jpg,that and then a delete the type there and paste it above as well so now w,this controller now what we have to add the control yeah controller or control yeah controller and we're gonna call this geo poin
2451,8_10/00034.jpg,but again that's what the geo coder is and we also set up basically a ge,which is our drawable and also learn about in this it's going to set up a little activity for us so just t
2458,8_10/00050.jpg,we're setting our set onclicklistener and then basically just so we ca,back to a toggle is so we're going to do the most part then we're going to have a good review but <end
2501,8_10/00217.jpg,method which is basically that string and all the other good stuff jus,you guys kind of understand and we can just place it within this method that we just copy one and we can jus
2515,8_10/00252.jpg,to say v right there and then we're just going to kind of delete it out o,can just place it within this is just place it color or cut this else and can just place random color here <end
2529,8_10/00278.jpg,this code and instead of doing a new view we're going to just sa,that one in the xml stuff like that one in there since we imported the time so we can use the onclicklistener s
2642,8_118/00016.jpg,guys need permission for the internet so i forgot to add it to the men,all this tutorial again just all that now the edit text this actually want to show this again or i'm going to don'
2653,8_118/00044.jpg,for this web view type object but let's just make sure we check out ou,again the apk hit this application again with our view i said i save it starts or the text so it's kind <end
2655,8_118/00052.jpg,browser we click on it as of now nothing is there and then we're hopefull,and the point so you guys enjoyed that and we're going to look for the video confusing for the most part a ne

2739,8_126/00043.jpg,android name is equal to android dot up wit again dot provider and we'r,not what that has to start off some space to this text and we're going to do real quick if you can ge
2778,8_126/00155.jpg,again gonna do just allow us to access that status bar and you know clea,our on create method that's pretty simple up so how we need to set up our edit text that we created our xm
2819,8_126/00340.jpg,anything again we're just gonna refer to the class that it opens so we'r,gonna say get and we're gonna call this body because it's gonna say if statement there we go now we're gonna do tha
2845,8_126/00407.jpg,so as it is just clip the video save some time but basically i just sai,over into our drawable folder so there so now we can just copy this it's going to show you guys kind of th
2849,8_126/00422.jpg,good so now what we're gonna do is we're basically going to go into our yo,just kind of a second and now we have our surface view so we're not a surface view so we're just going t
2866,8_126/00496.jpg,there we go we kind of have our scale variables set up now what we'r,just put like sleep we're gonna say case to have our plus our motion event dot get any errors it's gonna get an
2878,8_132/00020.jpg,print a ball again just centered everything is pretty much the sam,again we can still get height there so now when we say motion a common motion our starting y and then we're gonn
2912,8_132/00139.jpg,bundle we're going to say got basket first then you guys will have t,so we're going to set up variables all we're gonna do is type bitmap is going to be a string builder we wan
2947,8_132/00269.jpg,equal to which is question we're going to say dot set text and then we'r,space to the first type string and then again we're just gonna refer to the same thing we have a little bit overrid
2979,8_12/00089.jpg,basically the bridge from xml so i'm going to set that up real quickl,are going to say this state above our selection list because again we just have there we go we get set this u
2987,8_12/00102.jpg,the initialize method and just kind of have to refer that prett,are using or whatever our pause so then we can say open clasp right now what we want to show you <end
3009,8_12/00146.jpg,again alright hopefully everything works now but uh alright that's bette,what the default package i'm going to say travis and that's going to show you guys edit one this is kind of typ
3010,8_12/00147.jpg,and then we're gonna say jessica alba is and then startactivity perfect a,use the way that won't might already already this is just open and write some buttons there we go but keep all thre
3028,8_12/00225.jpg,protected data protected void on pre execute and again we can refe,about we're going to give it our variable that's fine i don't really tedious thing that through this run for <end
3042,8_13/00039.jpg,variables some for setting up something and we get that f or that string an,to return a resume way with within parentheses and we're going to do is we need to reference it adds our columns an
3045,8_13/00044.jpg,can just set that equal to whatever and there w,dialog equals new progress called my hotness there we go we might do is create method again we're just going to set thi
3140,8_133/00109.jpg,[music] array which is basically going t,let me say public so what we need to close our aren't actually need to close creates progress dialog is going to sa
3239,8_127/00122.jpg,add you know are touchy that we have set up down here touching class so no,and that's what we're gonna animate you we can also set our ad it takes at the point class to this geo <end
