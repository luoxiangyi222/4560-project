625,"This bug was the result of some related back-end changes, which will be corrected in the next build.  Kinda glad this broke, an even earlier change could be made even faster/cheaper for the wiki-redirect case...and now is."
2038,"If the changes to be made are so minor that you can't find anything else to change, then just move on. In my experience, there is rarely a post that needs edits where there is not more than six characters to fix. Even so, there are plenty of other posts that are in serious need of editing. Once you get to 2000 reputation you won't have to worry about it."
1458,"This is a Stack Exchange network thing, and the general explanation (as described on Meta Stack Overflow) is: We don't usually require sticky IPs (in particular once you're logged
  in it shouldn't be an issue), but if during the process of logging in
  your IP address changes, that's extremely fishy, and that's why we
  bail out. It's hard to say for certain why this would be happening, but my guess would be that Opera's Turbo service is distributed over a number of proxy servers, and so your requests in the middle of the log in process ended up coming from different physical servers, and therefore resolved to different IP addresses. Turning off Turbo would cause all requests to originate from your device without travelling through the proxy, so it would make sense that doing so would prevent the rapidly changing IPs and allow you to log in."
1273,"Alternative spellings are good, because they provide different search paths.  Editing a post just to change ""wifi"" to ""Wi-Fi"" would seem to me to be the very definition of a ""too minor"" edit. Like a lot of tech terms, there is no universally accepted spelling. (Not to say that there aren't style guides that try to standardize on one or the other, but we don't adhere to one of those.) Now, if you'd spelled it as ""wife"" (as I've done more than once) then it should definitely be fixed. Otherwise you've got a question better suited for marriage.stackoverflow.com. Similar to how we don't change posts from British spellings, I think for the most part this should just be left alone."
1148,"I've re-opened it.  I don't think one person verifying that they can see the buttons is enough to say that no one else will be unable to see them, like you.  I can't think of any reason why this would be happening to you and only you, so I think it passes the ""potentially useful to others"" metric. The nature of the question obviously changed due to the comments, however &mdash; it's some combination of your account/location/environment/app version/etc. and the particular apps rather than something about the particular apps that affects everyone.  I've edited it as such, please make sure to do such editing yourself when possible.  Secondly the question would benefit from extra information, such as:"
