62,"I would say [Android-2.2] or [2.2]. I have no idea what most of the code names refer to, and the phones specs I see online only give the version number, not the code name.  I use a phone with android 1.5 - I know it is 1.5, I don't know what variety of food I would refer to it by. And you could tell me in the comments, but I think most new-ish users would have no idea."
119,"droid.io for ""Android Input/Output""  ""I/O, refers to the communication between an information processing system, and the outside world possibly a human."" This fits in two ways: I know the .io is a little unconventional but I think the name flows nicely and it's short."
872,"Unfortunately, the name ""Android Enthusiasts"" is so close to generic that it's very unlikely we'd be able to stop them from using it. However, our wonderful core developers have told me it's pretty easy to make that hyperlink in the Google results say ""Android Enthusiasts - Stack Exchange"" rather than ""Android - Stack Exchange,"" so that change will be implemented soon. If you're looking to become their friends, maybe a representative from this site could join one of their future hangouts as a special guest? Just a suggestion; interact or don't interact with them as you wish. :) As Matthew Read pointed out, this site is the top Google hit when searching ""Android Enthusiasts"" so there's nothing to worry about right now. They probably just didn't know this site exists and already uses the name they decided to adopt a week ago."
641,"My first thought was that the name Galaxy S actually refers to a series of 9+ devices, but we should probably make the synonym you suggest and create samsung-galaxy-s-series is there's a need for it. I've merged and synonymized the tags."
1710,"Adding the tag to your favourites doesn't actually create the tag, so it doesn't matter whether you have enough reputation or not. It just adds that tag name to a list in your profile. If a tag is subsequently created with that name, the tag will be in your favourites; until then, it has no effect. If there's an error here, it's only that the behaviour is a little confusing. BTW, there's not much point adding a new tag if there's only one question it relates to. Tags with one or zero questions are automatically removed after some time. We also wouldn't normally add a device tag to this particular question, because it doesn't appear to be specific to this model: the same problem could just as easily arise with a different device."
