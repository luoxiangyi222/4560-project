1207," Flow answered:  I own 3 Android Devices. A Galaxy S running CM10, and Thinkpad Tablet running stock Android and a Kindle Fire running CM10. I use mostly the SGS and the Thinkpad Tablet. The Fire lies around the living room.  Liam W answered:  I own 2 Android devices. My SGS2, and my Arnova GBook. I use my SGS2 all the time, and my GBook (which isn't that good), to listen to spotify offline at night ;)  Liam W continued: My SGS2 runs CM10, whereas I just managed to root my GBook with difficulty.  Suraj Bajaj answered:  I am poor guy I tell ya! :( I own one (keep changing between CM 9 and 10, and other experimental ROMs) but I use bunch of them. :) You will find most of my friends' and family members' devices lying around me. I keep playing with them and also use them for testing my apps and experimenting some new stuff. :)"
441,"If these tags are worth keeping, then the Windows and Windows XP tags should probably be kept separate.  I know there was at least one question about the Galaxy S drivers for Windows 7 x64, which are different from the 32-bit XP drivers, for example.  The one question tagged Windows XP involves driver issues, which might be specific to XP.  There's another question about having a PC rebroadcast WiFi for a phone, which is Windows 7 specific.   Edit: I withdraw the below.

Personally, I don't think these tags have any value.  Information about what OS you're using or a problem using a device connected to an OS should be in the question and stay out of the tags.  Most of the time it's incidental information not useful for classification, and the rest of the time it's a classification that I don't think is needed."
1308,"My opinion, which I've expressed in the past: Although the Galaxy Nexus is an Android phone off-the-shelf, I don't think that installing or using Ubuntu for phones is within the scope of our site. Questions related to running Ubuntu along side Android (in a chroot environment with VNC, for example) seem okay to me since Android is involved in the process, and we've handled a few here in the past. Using Ubuntu for phones requires completely replacing the Android OS with Ubuntu. At that point I think we've left the realm of Android Enthusiasts and entered into the realm of Ask Ubuntu. We're built around the Android ecosystem, and though the device may have been originally intended to run Android, using it for a completely different purpose seems beyond our expertise and our scope. I wouldn't expect a Microsoft support forum to help me install Ubuntu on a desktop because it originally came with Windows - I'd expect an Ubuntu community to help me."
312,"We can now at least use direct links to Market apps that use a normal URL scheme and will work as links on both the phone and your PC.  No need to use a market://.... link, we can use   Eg this link should take you to the app's Market page on a normal web browser, and if clicked from an Android browser should take you into the app's page in the Market app:  What's more the Android market web pages even have a QR code on them. Anyone know if there'd be a problem embedding the QRs from the Market server in here, they use the normal Ggoogle Charts API to create the QR, like this: |0&amp;cht=qr&amp;chl=http%3A%2F%2Fmarket.android.com%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.rovio.angrybirds Which in an image link gives us:  Which should all be a lot more useful (and less confusing to the casual visitor) than sending someone to Appbrain, or the like."
1403,"Keep the wiki excerpt short and focused on what the tag means on this site. For instance, email doesn't need to describe what electronic mail is, but rather it should explain that it is for question about email on Android devices in general and the built-in default email app in particular. Also, don't include an instruction to ""see the info link below"" to direct the reader to the full tag wiki. While that works on the tag info page, the wiki excerpt is displayed in multiple other places (like the mouseover window) where there is no ""info"" link for the reader to click."
