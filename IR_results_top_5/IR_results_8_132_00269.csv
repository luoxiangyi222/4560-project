488,"I really like the design - very clean &amp; elegant. It does occasionally feel a little bit washed out / monochrome however. I'm sure there are specific elements that could be a bit darker or more colourful without changing the overall elegant feel. I think the most constructive thing to do would be to try and identify specific elements like this, as GAThrawn did here. A few more little accents and highlights like this and I'm sure it would all click together beautifully!"
581,"I guess I fall into the ""middle class"" type of user (at the moment). I like to think I'm being generally helpful and contributing, but there's definitely a large, empty gap in the middle rep ranges which I've wondered about for a while. I'm going to go ahead and throw out a couple of things I've personally observed which have a negative impact on the number of available answerable questions. I don't claim any kind of statistical backing to any of this, mind you: That said, I also think that it's somewhat hard to attract real power users to a Q&amp;A site like this. Now I'm not saying we can't or that we should give up because I really enjoy having Android Enthusiasts around, but the nature of the beast is that much of what happens on e.g. XDA is very discussion based. There's a lot of trial and error, people experimenting with things and almost bricking their phones then collaborating on solutions, and developers putting out bleeding-edge stuff for others to test and give feedback on. We just can't cater to that here, and I think it does affect our userbase to some extent. Is it necessarily a bad thing? No, I don't think so. I'm personally glad to be able to come here when I have a question so that I can ask it without it getting lost in a sea of discussion and just get answers. I do think that it's a little bit of a handicap, though. That turned out to be a bit more lengthy than I intended, but that's my $0.02."
1820,"As stated some of your comments are good as answers in their own right. I'm only adding this as it is something I still do. I'm not sure if it's lack of confidence, or some of the HUGE answers to big questions I've read here.  Don't forget answers are fluid things, you can always edit and amend them. People will comment on your answers, and you can always factor that in. You and I need to just start posting answers more often!  Sometimes an answer is just ""No you can't"" like my recent answer here and that's about it. But that is the actual, correct answer!  A good rule I use is try not to recommend the 'nuclear option' as your first advice, it happens a fair bit. My SMS is not sending, factory reset. The brightness is too low, Factory Reset!  This answer I'm writing here is a good example of something that borders on a comment, but in the spirit of things I'm adding it as an answer! "
682,"BlueTooth is wireless, but it isn't wifi. Depending on the use, I could see wireless-network and wireless-networking merged, but Wifi is a specific type of wireless technology. Grammatically, ""wireless-networking"" refers to the concept or practice, and ""wireless-network"" refers to a implemented instance. But I doubt those subtleties are present..."
641,"My first thought was that the name Galaxy S actually refers to a series of 9+ devices, but we should probably make the synonym you suggest and create samsung-galaxy-s-series is there's a need for it. I've merged and synonymized the tags."
