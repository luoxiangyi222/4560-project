1917,"which newest questions are unanswered  which questions are put on hold  questions with a high bounty  There is simply no way to include every possible search combination as a UI filter, it would be insanely cluttered and completely unusable. If you want to search for a narrower subset of questions instead of a broad category, that's exactly what search is for and what it's good at.  A huge list of filters in the UI is just going to slow you down. You should take a look at  and familiarize yourself with the search operators you find most useful!"
1246,"IMHO there is now way to hold people from posting off-topic/low-quality questions. And this is a OK because if SE would show a big disclaimer before a question could be asked, the usability would suffer. The only way to filter out off-topic questions is afterwards, like the system does now."
1030,I suggest simply making the jailbreak a synonym of rooting. This way users who try to use the tag are automatically pointed to the right term/tag.
2358,"Many common link-shorteners are already blocked by the site because of the problems that they pose. As a general rule, editing the post to replace the shortened links with regular ones is the right way to go, and the same applies with ad-based shorteners. If you feel a specific user is especially overbearing with the links then leaving a comment may not be a bad idea. Flagging one of their posts for the mod team to look at is also a reasonable option, particularly if you find the links to be of questionable usefulness and more for the purpose of driving traffic through the link service."
1992,"While I can follow Firelord's argumentation, it still seems rather a comment than an answer. As a comment, it would be very acceptable: ""It may be … Could you try …"". Then, with the OP having tried and approved, it would be a good answer: solving the issue as proven. Or it would stay a comment when not proven. My approach thus would have been: Flag NAA, leave a comment, convert to comment on the question. BUT: answerer included ""solve the issue as it did for me"", which in fact is kind of prove (empirical) – so it seems to be a valid answer. I agree however it could use a little re-phrasing to make that clear: In my case, this was an issue with Google Now. I was able to solve it this way: Guess you agree: put that way, you wouldn't complain :) EDIT: Sorry for being a bit unclear. I of course didn't mean to say one should always place a comment first :) So in short:"
