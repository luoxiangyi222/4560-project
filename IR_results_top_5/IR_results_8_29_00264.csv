72,"Pulling this out of comments so it can receive proper votes, if it's the way to go:  [version-codename] 2.1-Eclair 2.2-Froyo This avoids the overly-verbose ""android"" in the tag, and it makes the tag findable with the auto-complete if you start typing either the version number or the codename."
