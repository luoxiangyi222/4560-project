Change the color in the center for bronze/silver/gold. The buttons here  are definitely viable for both. They gray/silver could be for normal tags, the yellow for featured tags. How about this?  It's actually an arm from the Android mascot. Perhaps not as in-your-face green, but the radius of the curve evokes Android."
823,"I think as long as it's clear you're good to do whatever you want.  Like GAThrawn I would leave the keyboard buttons for actual buttons, though I tend to use bold or nothing for them myself.  I also tend to use inline code for menu items.

That said, if you browse that tag, you can see that there are some questions there which are about using Android as a development platform, which is OK. If your question is about using Android, it's OK, even if you're a developer or you want to use it for things related to software development. For example, there are some questions in that tag about using Android to write Python code for use on other platforms. They're relevant to our community because the same issues might come up with other text editing tasks. Obviously if the question were along the lines of ""I used my Android phone to write this Python code ... but it doesn't work. What's wrong with my code?"" that question would be off-topic, because then it's not about using Android any more."
