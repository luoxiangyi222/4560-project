699,"In going back through the unanswered questions, the following twelve seemed to be more likely to garner a response or interest from average user types.  "
475,"Sure. There are plenty of great topics for blog posts that can hopefully go far above and beyond being a mere reference answer for common questions If this gets traction, coordinate with rebecca@stackexchange.com and she can get a provisional blog set up."
72,"Pulling this out of comments so it can receive proper votes, if it's the way to go:  [version-codename] 2.1-Eclair 2.2-Froyo This avoids the overly-verbose ""android"" in the tag, and it makes the tag findable with the auto-complete if you start typing either the version number or the codename."
863,"This has been already asked already on MSO, although without &quot;official&quot; answer. There's also this answer by Jeff Atwood (admittedly, two years old, and before creation of the diverse family of Area 51 sites) specifically on a question whether English-only policy should be in the FAQ: Do we really need a NO ELEPHANTS sign? I mean, isn't such a thing obvious? Would you go to a forum where everyone was communicating in French and type Hey French Dudes, I got a question but I don't know French so I'm just going to go ahead and ask it in English anyway? Note that this is different from Stack Overflow, where English is a strict requirement. There doesn't seem to be a general consensus or an ex cathedra response, and it seems that it's up to each community to decide for themselves. Although I can appreciate why people would want to be able to ask questions in other languages than English (I'm not a native English speaker either, nor even live in a country where English is an official language), allowing this on Android-SE is going to be a major PITA from pretty much any perspective -- moderation, quality, percentage answered questions, user participation -- for a small to negligible benefit."
817,"How many questions of this type are we talking about? How many questions are migrated from here to SO on a daily basis? This would be a fair amount of work, and I'd need to know that it's because there are 10+ questions of this type. Often for low volume stuff, handling it manually is the best option until the volume increases. It's also a little tricky since the intrinsic tag on this site has to exist on the target site, etc. Looking here:  I see 10 questions going to SO for the month of November."
