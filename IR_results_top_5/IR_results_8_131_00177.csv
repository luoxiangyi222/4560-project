841,"I think you're seeing one of two behaviours that changed recently with @replies. Essentially the @reply isn't auto-completed (and is often removed when you post) if there is only one possible, unmistakable person who's the target of your post and so your @name bit would be redundant. So if you're making a comment on a question that has no answers, and it's the very first comment, then you are obviously making a comment to the questioner, so adding @name is redundant. The other thing that's changed is that when SE thinks that two people are having a conversation (when there's only two of you commenting and you're going back and forth between you) then the @name is removed too, as it's obvious who you're talking to. In these cases even though there's no @name in your comment, because it's obvious who you're talking to the person that you're talking to will still get notified that you're talking to them (for instance question askers are always notified when someone comments on their question with @naming anyone else)."
896,"Well, you know, there are such things as on-topic questions that no one can answer. Or, more accurately, the person who can answer just hasn't visited the site. A well-written question with the right keywords will certainly draw websearch traffic, so it's only a matter of time until we get an answer (we hope). On the other hand, dozens of ""how do I install OS (x) on device (y)"" won't be helpful. A canonical question to trap them all would be good."
1011,"Android Stack Exchange gets more than its fair share of ""drive by"" posters. I don't know that that will ever change. As for what to do, I think you've been doing the right thing. But I'll reiterate: Remember: The Questions and their Answers aren't just for the person asking the question, but for future readers as well. A question with good answers is a good thing to have, even if the original asker will never return. On the other hand, questions that no one cares about, not even to answer or vote up, aren't useful to anyone. That's why they're automatically deleted after some time. Six months, if memory serves; four weeks is too short a time."
1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
872,"Unfortunately, the name ""Android Enthusiasts"" is so close to generic that it's very unlikely we'd be able to stop them from using it. However, our wonderful core developers have told me it's pretty easy to make that hyperlink in the Google results say ""Android Enthusiasts - Stack Exchange"" rather than ""Android - Stack Exchange,"" so that change will be implemented soon. If you're looking to become their friends, maybe a representative from this site could join one of their future hangouts as a special guest? Just a suggestion; interact or don't interact with them as you wish. :) As Matthew Read pointed out, this site is the top Google hit when searching ""Android Enthusiasts"" so there's nothing to worry about right now. They probably just didn't know this site exists and already uses the name they decided to adopt a week ago."
