580,"A few projects in the works that may remediate some of these concerns: Improving the algorithm that controls the official Twitter account so that it brings better content and value to followers. Building relationships with mobile &amp; Android blogs for upcoming collaborations (You will soon see an ad for Android Guys in the sidebar + an upcoming program that will ""port"" over our Android release calendar wiki to Android Guys and other outside sites - Please let me know if you know someone else who wants to host this release calendar). Contests! - This relates to both bullets above. Expect a giveaway in the near future executed through Twitter/Facebook in collaboration with an outside Android and/or mobile site. Any other ideas? Further questions? Also, does anyone have a connection at a major Android manufacturer who can help me get a hold of a Thrill, Bionic, Vigor or Galaxy S II?"
77,There are now several people is one lonely guy with 1000+ reputation. (Didn't we get temporary mods?) This is probably no longer necessary.
175,"Yes, excellent idea. It's great way to curb the redundant questions and it's a good sticky post that will likely get some link backs from other sites. Also, I agree, the answers should be updated in the question.  It will get very unwieldy having a separate answer for each phone.  Maybe something like this: Title: 
When will my phone get Android 2.3 (Gingerbread)? Body: 
Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) was released on November 11th, 2010.  This community wiki will list all of the known and rumored dates for devices. If you have an update make sure to follow the format that's been established, and the following guidelines:  If you don't have enough rep to edit the wiki, leave your suggestion in a comment or answer and someone will update the list.  HTC G1 Motorola Droid Motorola Droid X  Enter Tablets Here...  Enter other devices here..."
1556,"Already asked on StackOverflow Meta: EDIT #1: After Flow edited his question, my personal comment earlier is no longer relevant. However, I still agree on the Answer on the SO Meta posts above. Generally, we should edit to make the question clearer. If it's lacking information, we ask for clarifications via comments. We ask them to edit that into their question, or we update it ourselves, based on their comments.  We can either be proactive or guide them to read the guidelines. But I prefer to be more proactive, as if I were gathering requirements from the customer. We ask in a way that we get what we exactly need to make it understandable for us and for everybody. Regarding edits (and based on recent experience), chances are we may not always get it right. It happens. We're either too tired to understand / interpret it correctly (or it's not in our domain of expertise). OR, it could be that the question itself is too confusing to be rephrased. BUT, we can try to make it simpler and easier to read / understand. If our interpretation was wrong, the OP can always comment or improve our attempts to edit. This is peer review in action; we can't always be right. When all else fails - meaning, the question is helpless - the VTC and downvotes come in."
675,"The Android Guys are. The screen shot is obviously from today, as are a good number of the sample questions they suggest. I just wish they'd sorted questions by votes to showcase our ""best of"" stuff."
