171,"I'm trying to add this to (regular, non-hosted) gmail. I haven't added a lot of widgets, and I'm stumped the gadget URL is  It shows up, but is empty  and the gadgets settings tells me I need to configure an ID (of course)... but I can't find a way to configure the ID.  Does this not work for gmail -- which otherwise accepts gadgets --, or can I configure it?"
620,"Case in point:  There are others, however. (This particular question is way too specific, asking about a bug release version on a particular device, but it should illustrate the point.) Anyway, what do we want to do with questions like this? There is no official ""changelog"" we can refer people to, except where there is a major revision. Even so, a change to just the third node in the version number is almost certainly nothing but bug fixes. Frankly, I think questions like this should be closed as ""too localized"", but I'm afraid we're going to keep getting them. Would it be worth it to have canonical questions for each of the major versions? We could add point-releases like this to the major version if we can suss out what was changed."
1549,"If you don't take any time to learn anything about the site you're visiting, it's not going to work for you.  Start here. We're not obligated to help you, and we are a community-led site.  Driveby comments that can be left by anyone are not in our best interest.  You will notice that you don't even need to sign up to post a question or answer, however. Without knowing what question you're referring to or what your comment would be, it's hard to help you further."
1682,"The +100 rep association bonus is not counted in the protection algorithm. The post notice states (emphasis added): To answer it, you must have earned at least 10 reputation on this site. and the ""on this site"" part is actually quite literal, though not entirely clear. Therefore, looking at your rep history, you've got +100 for the association bonus and +5 for an upvote on one of your questions. That nets you 5 rep from your activities on this site, which is still shy of the 10 needed. There is also a more detailed explanation of the ""protected"" status on Meta Stack Exchange, for reference. In this specific case, the view count of the question is pretty low, so I'm going to remove the protection. It looks like it was applied because it picked up a bunch of non-answers within the first 24 hours, but then the views petered off after that."
1051,"It is a question with a definite, non-subjective answer (as long as you just say what has changed and how, and stay away from saying if it's an actual improvement or now). However it's also very localized in time. The answer is only ever going to be useful for someone with your make/model and firmware version. The number of people with that combination is going to shrink to none over time as people pick up and apply the update. I think that this is probably something that would need to be taken on a question by question basis, and probably only for very major updates (eg 2.3 -> 4), or updates that would affect a lot of devices in the same way (eg a TouchWiz or Sense UI update)."
