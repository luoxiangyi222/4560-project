666,"Not sure about smartphones. But there is also tablet, so maybe it makes sense to keep the smartphone tag also. I am in favor of blacklisting mobile-phones and cellphones. Matthew is right: If the phone functionality in question is calling, calls is the tag to go. And for everything else, mobile-phones and cellphones is to broad and inaccurate."
615,"I think it makes a lot of sense to split these up sensibly, I'd propose something like this Do we really need an app-blocking tag? The one question that I think you're nominating for it, is really a PC question rather than an Android one (and quite an edge case even there) I'd think it would be better off on SuperUser than here, and even then I think ""locking"" is probably closer to what is happening than blocking (seems to be to do with locked handles on mounted drives/files).  *I'd think that call-blocking should be set to a synonym of call-screening (as surely blocking is just a type of screening where you don't allow the call through after screening it). One of the call-screening questions even mentions blocking in the title."
654,"call-log, call-logs, call-logging -> call-history history was removed, browser-history created logcat -> logging, which is now used for system and other miscellaneous logging logs was removed, I figure it's too ambiguous to be merged with anything else"
1803,"I'm terrible at naming things like this, but a lot of the other chat rooms use amusing names to try to mix things up. One that popped into my head was something like: The Candy Shop A chat room for Android users to discuss devices, apps, the latest Android news and gossip, and how many warranties they've voided. Something that plays with the idea of Android releases being named after deserts and such. The description is intended to be a little more friendly but also informational. We probably do need to be conscious of the fact that the room listings only get you 40-50 characters before they truncate (you can see the full description by viewing the room info, though). Therefore, keeping the word ""users"" (or something like that) near the front of the description might be a good idea. Also, by not calling it ""Android"" we might help prevent people with programming questions from getting sucked in."
129,"Definitely something funny with search, I see no results searching for ""google earth""  Even though there's a question with those words in that order in the title, a tag called google-earth, and I can remember seeing another couple of questions lately that reference Google Earth in the main question text."
