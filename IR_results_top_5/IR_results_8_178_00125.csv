488,"I really like the design - very clean &amp; elegant. It does occasionally feel a little bit washed out / monochrome however. I'm sure there are specific elements that could be a bit darker or more colourful without changing the overall elegant feel. I think the most constructive thing to do would be to try and identify specific elements like this, as GAThrawn did here. A few more little accents and highlights like this and I'm sure it would all click together beautifully!"
762," Matthew Read answered: Android is by-and-large a fantastic site low on the problems faced by many other SE sites.  I don't see any policing aspects to the moderation job here and, regardless, it has to be about serving the community.  If you're not serving the community then you're not doing your job as a mod.  Matthew Read continued: If a community were to be so far gone that you need to really police it, cracking down on questions the community wants and so on, then probably the site isn't viable and I would have expected the team to step in and shut it down before that point.  Al Everett answered: ""Policing"" is looking around for bad actors and problems and doing something about it. ""Serving"" is, to me, is finding what the community needs and working to provide it. I think a moderator needs to do both, but as little as the former as possible to keep things civil.  eldarerathis answered: I'd say it's a bit of a fine line between the two. ""Policing"" to me implies being a bit more active in exercising moderation powers, whereas ""serving"" is a bit more passive, like responding to community flags and such. I would also say, though, that carrying out community consensus without always needing their explicit request (i.e. rules which were decided upon on meta) is serving - not policing. That's where I would generally fall.  Matthew Read clarified: I think I may have interpreted ""policing"" too harshly, based on Al and eldarerathis's answers :P I agree with dealing with problems and not being passive!  Bryan Denny answered: Policing is a bit too strong.  Policing happens when I only want to see things I want to see on the site rather than what the community wants to see. I should be here to facilitate (serve) the community, not my own whims  Flow answered: Serving the community. Policies can change. In fact the should be adjusted from time to time by the community. That assures a healthy climate and progress."
773,"I was a little disappointed when I opened this and discovered that I will not be receiving free ice cream sandwiches all week, but this idea is neat, too. One suggestion: Could we enforce some kind of minimum question score in order to be eligible for any drawings? Entering everybody would allow people to post really bad questions like ""Why is ICS so AWESOME!"" just to get an entry. I'd be inclined to say that only questions with a score greater than zero should be eligible (so at least someone else thought it was a good question). (I also realize this would be a bit different than the Kindle Fire contest, where it appeared that people with zero score posts were entered into the drawing provided that no other answers on the question were upvoted)"

797,"GAThrawn's answer is spot-on, but I'd like to add a little more information."
