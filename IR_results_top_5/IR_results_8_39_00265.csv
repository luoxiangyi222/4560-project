886,"Nope.  Once you create a bounty, you lose that rep forever.  I think you used to be able to award it to yourself but it ""didn't count"", and now it's just the more sensible solution of not letting you award it to yourself at all. If someone else is able to help or independently discovers the same fix as you, you may want to consider giving them the bounty.  Otherwise just let it expire &mdash; if it does without you awarding it, half the rep will go to the highest-scoring answer if it's at +2 or more, if there is such an answer.  (If not, no one gets any.)"
1516,"This is quite possibly my fault (though the system should probably handle it better). At the end of last week How do you link to applications in the Android market? came up in my Close Votes queue as a dupe of How to post a link to an android market app? but after looking at the two questions, it was obvious that one had old, out-of-date and (now-)incorrect answers (one answer was by me) whereas the other one had answers that are current and correct. In my opinion the Close As Dupe vote had been cast on the wrong question (based on which one had the currently good answers) so I ""Leave Open"" voted the one and I submitted the first VtC on the other. Having explained what I did though, the system really should show what's going on in a clearer manner, and handle the situation where one is Closed as a Dupe while the other is still in the vote to close phase."
2132,"This was discussed in Is it ever acceptable to prod a user into accepting an answer? and in the posts linked there. The comment by Jeff Atwood is worth repeating: I would only remind users who have shown signs they are going to stick around. Reminding a drive-by user isn't useful. A drive-by user might have posted their question on five forums, got an answer at three, of which they read one - and it wasn't yours. Chances are they'll never be seen again, at least not from the same account. So the comments just create noise for others reading the post.  Other things to consider:"
2358,"Many common link-shorteners are already blocked by the site because of the problems that they pose. As a general rule, editing the post to replace the shortened links with regular ones is the right way to go, and the same applies with ad-based shorteners. If you feel a specific user is especially overbearing with the links then leaving a comment may not be a bad idea. Flagging one of their posts for the mod team to look at is also a reasonable option, particularly if you find the links to be of questionable usefulness and more for the purpose of driving traffic through the link service."
29,"I think a lot of good points have already been made here but after taking a look at the existing questions, I really think people need to take a good hard look at this: Edit - I missed a few, and more just keep coming and coming... Guys, this is seriously awful.  We are just one day into the beta and out of 109 questions on the site, 22 of them (over 20%) are about which apps are ""good/bad/best"" - yikes! Worse, almost none of them are Community Wiki, so people are actually gaining rep for asking and answering the most mundane and subjective questions imaginable. I think this list very dramatically illustrates the problem with allowing these questions.  There's no end to them.  What's the best compass app?  What's the best flashlight app?  What's the best ukelele simulation app?  Gah! Is this what we're going to be, just a glorified review site?  Is it really that hard to just go to the market and read the reviews?  The Android developers have already built us this beautiful rating and review system that you can access right on your phone.  We don't need this fluff. Please, please, let's start closing these questions.  At the very least close them until we have moderators who can properly wikify them, but even then, I don't want to see people's 1-line recommendations taking up 20% of the site.  This is turning into a land grab with everybody wanting to own one of the big bad 500+ upvoted poll questions.  If we don't nip this in the bud, it's going to bite us hard later on. P.S. I'm not saying every question about an app is bad.  Here are two that are fine: In the first example, somebody is looking for a very specific app and has provided criteria to significantly narrow down the list of candidates.  In the second example, the author is asking for a comparison of two specific apps.  I see no problem with either of these. I just don't want to see two hundred ""Post your favourite [X] app"" polls by the time we hit public beta."
