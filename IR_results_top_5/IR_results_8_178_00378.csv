856,"Thanks alot Lauren.
I have sent you an email about my contact information. I don't know exactly how you are going to do this? Do you have the Kindle Fire at home, or are you going to order it? Because it can't be ordered from Amazon to Denmark. But it can be sent with the normal air mail directly to me.  But again thanks alot, and looking forward to be an active member on this lovely website :D"

The little bumper at the bottom would be a fun trick to play around with if we were going to have a page/comment load transition."

1162,The flavor of Markdown that Stack Exchange uses doesn't support this. I would be against it in any case. Underlines are very commonly understood to indicate links when on web sites. You mess with this very basic and well-understood UI element at your peril. (I can't tell you how many times I've been on some web site and tried to click underlined text and nothing happened.) See also: Why can we format text with bold and italic but not underline? It's been brought up before and unless you can devise a compelling new argument it's not going to be implemented.
1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
