2095,"I agree with Al's point. Of course the natural mechanism of the system takes care of such bad/strange answers. However, in some cases, it can be hard giving a very specific answer, thus resorting to using  ""I think..."" or ""Your best bet probably is..."" or ""I haven't tried this app so I don't know but..."" ""I think"" at this point, ""your best bet probably is"" that not everything that works on my phone will work for someone else's phone. Android is Android, yet there are so many caveats, that make giving certain answers sometimes hard to do in different situations. Until one has had the opportunity to use over the 10,000 different types of devices that exist today, I doubt anyone can give 100% certain answers on everything. For instance, in answering this question, I used the expression, ""could"", pointing out that, I'm not certain. Although TWRP saved my life some time ago on my Z2, does not necessarily mean it will work for this OP. I wasn't certain it will work, not because I don't know what I was saying, but because what works for me is different from what will work for someone else. Of course, outright nonsense answers need to be flagged, yet, the idea of suggestions aren't all bad, as what works for me won't work for my friend next door, always! TL;DR Not knowing an answer to a question is different from not being certain something'll work for the OP. Thus, I don't think the use of ... ""I think..."" or ""Your best bet probably is..."" or ""I haven't tried this app so I don't know but..."" ... is entirely a bad thing."
1531,"Usually questions that could fill a whole book as answer are closed as ""too broad"" on all sites within the SX network. I can't comment on why this hasn't happened on the Security SX example question you gave. The have the same policy about ""too broad"" as any other site. But as eldarathis pointed out, the two questions are not on the same level regarding broadness. QA sites like Android Enthusiasts work best if you have a specific problem. And no, wanting to know how Android works is not a specific problem."

Make sure to include the version info of the buggy software and the version that fixed the problem."
2363,"This site isn't a forum. There aren't ""follow-ups"" here: there are questions and answers. If you want to ask a question, use the Ask question button. If you know the answer to a question, write it in Your answer under that question. It doesn't matter how relevant it is: if it's not an answer to the question, it doesn't belong there. People who know the answer to your question won't see it if it's not posted as a question, and they can't help you, because you can't answer an answer. Running the site in this format is what makes it a repository of information that's easy to find and navigate, without the problems of thread hijacking and ""me too"" posts that you get on a forum. It means that people who know about the thing you're asking about will see your question on the front page of the site: you're not relying on them looking on the n-th page of a thread about a related question that they're not going to look at because they already know the answer. The tour is a really brief introduction to all of this. You get a badge for reading it, but more importantly, you also learn how to get your questions answered by experts."

If they were both running ROMs running Sense UI that would suggest that perhaps it wasn't necessarily a hardware-specific issue and those of us trying to help should focus more on their particular firmwares and not just the phones themselves.  When travis said he didn't know I wanted to try to be clear when explaining to him what he needed to know in order to give me a useful answer. I hope that clarifies my seemingly off-topic comments.  :)"
