The automated chat link will also create a public room, so from that regard it's essentially the same (and you can give it whatever title you want). One downside is that the auto-inserted link will import the comments from the post into the chat room when it's created. Creating your own room beforehand will not do this, but if you are pre-emptively setting up a chat with someone then there is likely not going to be a long comment thread to import anyway, I'd imagine. This has also been discussed on Meta Stack Overflow."

It was an unpleasant surprise but  I fully respect his decisions.  Matthew leaving is a shocker coming out of the blue. At a personal level, I wouldn't have been an active member of this community without him guiding me out of (self created) mess. As they say of Veterans Old soldiers never die, they fade away ; leaving behind their imprints and inspiring us to do better. I wish both  veterans, the best and hope that they do not go off the radar and continue to help the community. "
0,817,"How many questions of this type are we talking about? How many questions are migrated from here to SO on a daily basis? This would be a fair amount of work, and I'd need to know that it's because there are 10+ questions of this type. Often for low volume stuff, handling it manually is the best option until the volume increases. It's also a little tricky since the intrinsic tag on this site has to exist on the target site, etc. Looking here:  I see 10 questions going to SO for the month of November."

0,279,"Well, the link is using rel=""nofollow"", so the site's not getting any googlejuice. Just because there's a link to a site does not mean that Stack Exchange or the members of the Android Enthusiasts site endorse it, and I don't think anyone would think that. Also, anyone who doesn't follow safe browsing is not going to be protected by us. Without a link it would be academic to find the site via other means. If the link went somewhere other than what it purported to (goatse anyone?) then it might be a problem. As is I don't think it is a problem. I'm interested in other opinions, however."
