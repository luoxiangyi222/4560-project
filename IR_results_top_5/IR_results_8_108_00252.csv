485,"You make a good point. I have updated the button styling a bit, both on the main site and on Meta. For the main site, I made the button text green, and for Meta they're much darker now.  The changes will be in the next deployment."
1718,"I think the others covered it well but obviously I should chime in.  Al in particular is correct when he says I should have left it for another mod. The new comment ignored the Meta thread and indicated that they hadn't even read the rest of the comments, which were bad main-site comments anyways that should have come to Meta.  So I pointed out that I had explained my view and where to find it, and deleted the old and oldly-closed question that seemed to remain to only attract bad attention (could be what you mean by ""quite popular""). Also should be noted is that the question already should have been deleted.  I did a bit of our usual delete-old-closed-questions yearly cleanup in January but have had no time to keep going since then."
1821,"I agree that we need clearer description about our chat room. Currently, it doesn't really tell anything, including the misunderstanding between general topic and programming-related (also, as seen on the main site...). The least we can do is to make them notice before they enter the room, which is the job for chat room's description. As for the name, actually I don't really have an issue with it. Of course, unique and memorable name is better if possible. My idea is more-or-less like this: Droid Lover A place to have general discussion about Android. If you have a problem related to Android app development, please go to Stack Overflow or its chat. Finally, relax, and enjoy the sweets! (feedback and corrections are really appreciated since I'm not a native speaker)"

856,"Thanks alot Lauren.
I have sent you an email about my contact information. I don't know exactly how you are going to do this? Do you have the Kindle Fire at home, or are you going to order it? Because it can't be ordered from Amazon to Denmark. But it can be sent with the normal air mail directly to me.  But again thanks alot, and looking forward to be an active member on this lovely website :D"
