1490,"I think it might be beneficial to make the wording of the first one more broadly applicable than just ""software development questions"". Something like: Questions about writing and publishing Android apps, writing custom ROMs, and other topics that are primarily of concern to developers are off-topic. Consider taking advantage of other resources that may be appropriate for your question. The reason I'm inclined to link to Where can I ask questions that aren&#39;t Android Enthusiast questions? instead of SO directly is that there are things in that statement (publishing and such) that SO would likely close as well."
39,"I totally thought the same thing about the 'android-app' tag being redundant. We should choose which one is the ""authoritative"" tag and edit all the questions to use that one.  I vote we use ""applications"". (Is there a way to blacklist tags?)"
1329,I'd like to hear other opinions too but my stance is that it's ok. Especially since you are an (active) member of the site and sure going to watch the ankidroid tag.  I'd like to make it clear that it's was 100% correct to ask first. Android Enthusiasts should not become a support/discussion forum for the various Android Apps out there if they Apps have a dedicated forum or help site. The question that remains is: Does AE.SX become a second place for Ankidroid support or are you going to close/archive the Google Group?
1084,I'd like to ask for opinions about the following idea: ATM is not possible to see if a question that is taged application was already reviewed. Therefore my motivation to review the application tag is very low. I suggest we retag every question that has been reviewed either with a more approbiate application tag or rename application to android-application. If the application count is zero android-application can become application again.
69,"This is a dedicated android site. 
Any tag that would NOT have ""android"" in it is on the wrong site.
Any tag that explicitly has ""android"" in it is redundant. As an Android site, the un-qualified version# of Android is a legitimate tag.
As an Android site, the un-qualified version# of a random application is not a legitimate tag (and would only be so on a site dedicated to that application). [2.2] or [Froyo] s/b fine."
