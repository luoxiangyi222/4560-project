389,"Now that we have Android Web Market, do we still need QR? PS: should this be a separate question?"
419,"Since we're focused on Android, not iDevices, I don't think we need to be as ""strict"" about being very specific about devices or the distinction between hardware and OS. I think the only tags we need are iphone and maybe ios. If the type of device is really that important to the question, then it seems to me that the question is probably off-topic. By the by, some of the questions you're running into were migrated from the defunct gadgets.stackexchange.com. Android and iPhone were both on topic. Not sure if we should bother resurrecting those."
1803,"I'm terrible at naming things like this, but a lot of the other chat rooms use amusing names to try to mix things up. One that popped into my head was something like: The Candy Shop A chat room for Android users to discuss devices, apps, the latest Android news and gossip, and how many warranties they've voided. Something that plays with the idea of Android releases being named after deserts and such. The description is intended to be a little more friendly but also informational. We probably do need to be conscious of the fact that the room listings only get you 40-50 characters before they truncate (you can see the full description by viewing the room info, though). Therefore, keeping the word ""users"" (or something like that) near the front of the description might be a good idea. Also, by not calling it ""Android"" we might help prevent people with programming questions from getting sucked in."
2318,"Development related questions are always flagged as &quot;Off topic&quot; in AE. Either you are developing &quot;for&quot; Android or &quot;on&quot; Android, it's a question referring some &quot;Development&quot;. Just took an example: You can install compilers in Android devices. Lets assume you need to compile a program written in any language (commonly it's a development process).
You can build using your Android device, but what if it didn't compile properly? You can not ask those compilation issues in any of the Android platform forums, because its not related to &quot;Operating system&quot;  which you use to build your program. Its purely coding related issue. Better to be posted in coding forums. Similarly here &quot;It doesn't matter you build it 'for' or 'on' Android&quot;, OP tries to compile an app, so needs to be flagged as Off topic."
1821,"I agree that we need clearer description about our chat room. Currently, it doesn't really tell anything, including the misunderstanding between general topic and programming-related (also, as seen on the main site...). The least we can do is to make them notice before they enter the room, which is the job for chat room's description. As for the name, actually I don't really have an issue with it. Of course, unique and memorable name is better if possible. My idea is more-or-less like this: Droid Lover A place to have general discussion about Android. If you have a problem related to Android app development, please go to Stack Overflow or its chat. Finally, relax, and enjoy the sweets! (feedback and corrections are really appreciated since I'm not a native speaker)"
