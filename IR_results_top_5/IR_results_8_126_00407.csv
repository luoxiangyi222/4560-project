685,"Though I'm also not the kind of guy to ""Like"" or +1 sth, I'd +1 the idea of integrating +1."
2459,"Judging by the number of low-quality deleted answers on this question, it's just a question that has been high in Google search results for a long time. Such questions are most likely to attract spam answers because spammers want to attack the pages that get most views, or that show up in searches for their spam keywords. You'll notice some similarities between the ""helpful"" content of the spam answers - most likely, both were copied from the same source of generic advice. The third post you quote is the same kind of spam comment you can see on any blog nowadays."
1534,"You ""asked"" that second question, and offered the solution as an answer. As that solution worked for you, you should accept that answer. If in the future another answer shows up which seems more suitable, you can still accept that (and thus un-accept yours). So I'd go ahead :)"
941,"I've earned both badges over on Stack Overflow, and they did not exist until after I had already exceeded the 3000 rep level and had VTC privileges. There are still a lot of other ways that flags are important, though, and which contribute to your helpful flag count: Also, if you come across a paticularly old post that you really think should be closed (but is unlikely to receive much traffic), I would consider flagging it with the ""Other"" reason after you have cast a close vote, then briefly explaining your reasoning. Although there are tools available to 10k+ members and mods that show recent close votes, it's easy to neglect them, whereas flags are very prominent. That's probably not going to get you into Deputy/Marshal territory with any kind of speed, though."
926,"If you go to your reputation page in your profile and scroll all the way to the bottom, there should be a little checkbox labelled ""show removed posts"". Check that and you will see any posts that affected your reputation by virtue of their deletion. In your case, the +1 is likely from an answer that you downvoted which was then subsequently deleted, either by the owner or by a moderator. You get the 1 rep cost of the downvote back when the answer is deleted."
