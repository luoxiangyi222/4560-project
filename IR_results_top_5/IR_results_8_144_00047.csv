1973,"After discussing with two to three people and posting this type of question, I found that  No one has any objection on these type of question.  Since it is not possible for all to know about the file standard of android these type of questions will be helpful for people like me. I wanted to know where the saved wifi-passwords are stored and I got an answer from this SE site and therefore I wanted to know about the other files stores in same directory as that of the file which contained the saved wifi passwords.  So this type of questions can be helpful this way. Best Regards, Jasser"

I have sent you an email about my contact information. I don't know exactly how you are going to do this? Do you have the Kindle Fire at home, or are you going to order it? Because it can't be ordered from Amazon to Denmark. But it can be sent with the normal air mail directly to me.  But again thanks alot, and looking forward to be an active member on this lovely website :D"

I was going to just do it but maybe we should discuss a game plan. These are the android sites I frequent:"

This site is not at the point where moderators need to heavily triage flags, as yet.  That said, I also go fully through most queues regularly, so a flag is not strictly necessary."
