30,"My opinion: If the question specifies how an app would be ""like"" X, as in providing a list of required features/constraints, then that's OK. But in that case, you don't really need the ""App X"" in there.  I suppose it doesn't hurt, but you could just say ""I'm looking for an app with these 10 features."" Unless these questions are significantly constrained, there's no appreciable difference between them and What X app should I get? questions.  I'd at least be suspicious of any and all questions taking this format, as they are likely to be treated as polls."

277,"It looks like Bryan Denny's How do I root my phone? would be a perfect place to consolidate this, and a great resource to point all the rooting question-askers at. If he's happy for his answer to be Community Wiki'd, then it could be treated as a shared resource to put all the info in, the same way that the ""When is my phone getting [OS]"" questions are pointed to the two ""When will my phone get the Android 2.2 update (FroYo)?"" (and Gingerbread) questions started by Al Everett. That way all of the normal ""How Do I Root"" questions can be closed and pointed to Bryan's question, and the more unusual edge-cases can be treated on a case-by-case basis to see if they'll stand as their own separate question (but probably still with a link back to the main rooting question),"
186,"Don't post an answer that should be a comment. ""Me too"" answers will (eventually) get deleted and, as you've noticed, the community doesn't like them (hence the downvotes). To gain reputation: Ask good questions; make good answers. You're not the only one who is occasionally frustrated with the rep limits for activities on the beta sites. I've seen several such questions on  On the plus side, you'll get those reputation points back when your downvoted answer is deleted."
2411,"I don't think there's any way to get a notification, but after a question is migrated, the original question gets a banner to say what site it was migrated to, with a link to the question on the destination site."
