633,"I'm getting one and hope to be asking questions here.  Bryan and GAThrawn have explained why. A minor note: Until it's actually released, I expect we won't be accepting questions about it &mdash; the only ones we could answer with certitude pertain to the information Amazon has publicly released.  Just like with Ice Cream Sandwich, we won't speculate or post answers that say ""go look at this thing Eric Schmidt / Jeff Bezos said""; premature questions generally get closed. Just something to keep in mind before you migrate :)"
1120,"Your question says: There is already a similar question to this one, but mine is narrower in scope Yours is much more detailed, but I don't see how it's narrower in scope.  Your question says: Can I prevent such an app from running in the background? The other question says: Is there a way to prevent the service apps (or any other apps) from automatically running in the background? I don't see a difference.  You said ""That question was about saving memory"" but the question doesn't say that.  Regarding Jeff's comment on the other Meta question, I think there does need to be some form of distinction between the questions, not just between the ""desired answer"" and the ones given so far. You may take issue with the answers to the other questions (which are the same answers that yours was given), as have several of those who have asked them.  That's unfortunate, but it doesn't change the nature of the questions.  One option you would have is to put a bounty on one of them explaining that you want a solution for, and only for, preventing particular apps from running in the background. The reason why I want to do this is irrelevant. Perhaps it's to save battery. Perhaps it's another reason. This question is about how, not why. Questions like that are often received poorly; they're known as XY problems.  As a general rule, SE is about finding solutions to problems, rather than helping people with solutions they've already decided on.  That doesn't make your question off-topic or anything, but problem solvers tend to get annoyed in these cases. In the end, I believe the most basic answer to your question is ""rewrite the Android OS so it doesn't do that"" or something similar.  Given that, perhaps you can see why people want to give you alternatives. Going forward, I think it would be best to combine all of these question into one, as Flow said, with a single CW answer that address (1) why it may not be necessary/Android's design (2) the use of task killers and their drawbacks (3) solutions that actually prevent apps from running in the first place.  If that sounds agreeable I will create it once things are a bit more settled. Edit: I've created the question How can I stop applications and services from running? and closed all others as a duplicate of it.  Please feel free to add to, update, and correct it."
1314,"Unfortunately, I think there's simply not an ideal solution for situations like this at the moment. You can, however, upvote/favorite/bounty Invite low rep users to participate in chat over on MSO if you'd like (proposes allowing higher rep users to invite lower ones into chat). I'd say the best course of action currently is to just hash out as much as you can in the comments, then try to get that information edited into the question. If you reach that point then you can always flag comments for deletion as ""obsolete"", or flag one of the comments with a custom note along the lines of ""every comment after this one is now obsolete etc etc"". That way the comments can get cleaned up and the information will be retained. And, of course, you can encourage the OP to try their hand at answering some questions since you only need 2 answer upvotes to get chat privileges."
311,"I don't think that's necessary. For one thing it's not a change that would be all that universal. What use would, say, English.SE have for QR codes? Besides, the new web market puts QR codes right on the page. It's only a couple of clicks to get the URL for the image and add it to a message. "
320,"Unfortunately ""drive-by downvotes"" do happen. If there's only one down-vote, and no one's left any explanation, then I'd just re-read my question/answer make sure everything's as clear and accurate as I can make it, and then shrug it off and ignore the down-vote. It's not a serious matter and as Lie says, if you've only got one down-vote, then the majority of the community have no problem with your question. Most experienced community members here regularly leave comments on questions or answers they may think aren't as clear as they could be, or may not belong here, often without down-voting initially. So it's very unlikely to be one of them who've down-voted you. Ultimately, unless the down-voter comes here and explains their reasoning, we're really all just guessing why they did it. Your particular question, I thought was possibly border-line whether it should be here or not, but there was no way that you (or we) could know if it was ontopic or not, without having an answer to that tells us where the sim-lock is, and whether it's Android specific. It's a bit ""chicken-and-egg"" you can't tell if it's ontopic until someone answers to say it is (or not), and you may not always get a good answer if someone thinks it's off-topic. Personally I'd say on-topic, obviously someone disagreed."
