1992,"While I can follow Firelord's argumentation, it still seems rather a comment than an answer. As a comment, it would be very acceptable: ""It may be … Could you try …"". Then, with the OP having tried and approved, it would be a good answer: solving the issue as proven. Or it would stay a comment when not proven. My approach thus would have been: Flag NAA, leave a comment, convert to comment on the question. BUT: answerer included ""solve the issue as it did for me"", which in fact is kind of prove (empirical) – so it seems to be a valid answer. I agree however it could use a little re-phrasing to make that clear: In my case, this was an issue with Google Now. I was able to solve it this way: Guess you agree: put that way, you wouldn't complain :) EDIT: Sorry for being a bit unclear. I of course didn't mean to say one should always place a comment first :) So in short:"

1820,"As stated some of your comments are good as answers in their own right. I'm only adding this as it is something I still do. I'm not sure if it's lack of confidence, or some of the HUGE answers to big questions I've read here.  Don't forget answers are fluid things, you can always edit and amend them. People will comment on your answers, and you can always factor that in. You and I need to just start posting answers more often!  Sometimes an answer is just ""No you can't"" like my recent answer here and that's about it. But that is the actual, correct answer!  A good rule I use is try not to recommend the 'nuclear option' as your first advice, it happens a fair bit. My SMS is not sending, factory reset. The brightness is too low, Factory Reset!  This answer I'm writing here is a good example of something that borders on a comment, but in the spirit of things I'm adding it as an answer! "
238,"Sounds like something that would be quite useful. If it were one App per Answer, then each app could be individually voted up/down as well as comments left against it...so each answer in itself is useful..."
