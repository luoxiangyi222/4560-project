1870,I think its not possible to know from every android device in the world either if they use fastboot or odin or even which sequence of buttons they need to use...i think its just better a generic topic that should point people to xda-developers forum where they can find their right info for their devices plus more generic information about the process 
580,"A few projects in the works that may remediate some of these concerns: Improving the algorithm that controls the official Twitter account so that it brings better content and value to followers. Building relationships with mobile &amp; Android blogs for upcoming collaborations (You will soon see an ad for Android Guys in the sidebar + an upcoming program that will ""port"" over our Android release calendar wiki to Android Guys and other outside sites - Please let me know if you know someone else who wants to host this release calendar). Contests! - This relates to both bullets above. Expect a giveaway in the near future executed through Twitter/Facebook in collaboration with an outside Android and/or mobile site. Any other ideas? Further questions? Also, does anyone have a connection at a major Android manufacturer who can help me get a hold of a Thrill, Bionic, Vigor or Galaxy S II?"
493,"I think a big issue is going to be finding relevant conferences. Google IO sold out in a ridiculously short time, plus I'm pretty sure they don't put out a call for speakers. AnDevCon was OK, but I was pretty disappointed in it as an advanced Android user/developer. Might need to look to some more general conferences such as MADExpo which I saw advertised on MSDN. After a conference is found, finding a speaker shouldn't be a problem: there are plenty of Android fans and developers with plenty to say."
270,"I think we should.  We may not want to expand to Android dev questions and the like, but it would certainly be within the scope of the site to help Android Enthusiasts find resources when they want to get enthusiastic about modding/dev/etc."
762," Matthew Read answered: Android is by-and-large a fantastic site low on the problems faced by many other SE sites.  I don't see any policing aspects to the moderation job here and, regardless, it has to be about serving the community.  If you're not serving the community then you're not doing your job as a mod.  Matthew Read continued: If a community were to be so far gone that you need to really police it, cracking down on questions the community wants and so on, then probably the site isn't viable and I would have expected the team to step in and shut it down before that point.  Al Everett answered: ""Policing"" is looking around for bad actors and problems and doing something about it. ""Serving"" is, to me, is finding what the community needs and working to provide it. I think a moderator needs to do both, but as little as the former as possible to keep things civil.  eldarerathis answered: I'd say it's a bit of a fine line between the two. ""Policing"" to me implies being a bit more active in exercising moderation powers, whereas ""serving"" is a bit more passive, like responding to community flags and such. I would also say, though, that carrying out community consensus without always needing their explicit request (i.e. rules which were decided upon on meta) is serving - not policing. That's where I would generally fall.  Matthew Read clarified: I think I may have interpreted ""policing"" too harshly, based on Al and eldarerathis's answers :P I agree with dealing with problems and not being passive!  Bryan Denny answered: Policing is a bit too strong.  Policing happens when I only want to see things I want to see on the site rather than what the community wants to see. I should be here to facilitate (serve) the community, not my own whims  Flow answered: Serving the community. Policies can change. In fact the should be adjusted from time to time by the community. That assures a healthy climate and progress."
