1718,"I think the others covered it well but obviously I should chime in.  Al in particular is correct when he says I should have left it for another mod. The new comment ignored the Meta thread and indicated that they hadn't even read the rest of the comments, which were bad main-site comments anyways that should have come to Meta.  So I pointed out that I had explained my view and where to find it, and deleted the old and oldly-closed question that seemed to remain to only attract bad attention (could be what you mean by ""quite popular""). Also should be noted is that the question already should have been deleted.  I did a bit of our usual delete-old-closed-questions yearly cleanup in January but have had no time to keep going since then."
228,"Here was an interesting little experiment: Is there a Word Lens alternative/port for Android? I knew that ""Word Lens"" was a hot topic yesterday, and that question it turned out to be the most viewed post yesterday.  In fact it's gotten 219 views in the last 20 hrs where as the next most recent post to get 200 views was asked on the 8th, taking a week and a half to get to 282 views.  Of the most popular search terms that brought people here over the last day ""word lens android"" got 90 and the next most popular was Samsung i5500 2.2 with 6 visits.   Now as far as questions, this wasn't the best one on the site, and it probably wasn't very useful to building membership because people probably came here found that there is no such app and left.   The value of the experiment is that it goes to show how being mindful of whats trending and making good titles with good keywords is helpful in getting people here.  Now ideally if we are to seed questions based on hot topics they'd actually be useful (Like Al's ""When will my phone get Android 2.x?"" questions) so when they get here they find some value and stay.  "
349,"You probably had a reputation re-calc. The number on your profile doesn't change immediately when a question or answer (where you had upvotes/downvotes) is deleted. I do know that a number of old, closed, off-topic questions were deleted recently."
104,"Yes, same here on HTC Incredible with default browser. I suggest putting it on SO's meta site since it's probably a problem across all SE sites. It's similar to this question, which unfortunately doesn't seem to have many views. "
