264,"I definitely see now why it makes sense not to do this kind of tagging -- clicking the tag will show you all the questions where the user has Device X, when you really want to see all the questions about Device X. That said, many questions need device and OS info, and the tags are a convenient place to put it, for consistency reasons.  The information is always in the same place and clearly distinct from the question, so the potential answerer doesn't have to search the question for it (or remember it all as they read the question). I think the optimal solution would be to have separate fields for device and OS version that the asker could fill in if it's relevant.  The info could be shown in a separate box or something at the end of the question.  I'm not sure how much work this would be for the SE people or if it's desirable to modify this site / some sites this way, since it's clearly not applicable across the board.  Perhaps instead the FAQ could show a standard template that people should insert at the end of their question, something like:"
611,"I'm not a lawyer (I am a law student), but the short answer is likely &quot;yes.&quot; Third party interference in a contract (Tortious Interference) applies here, since you're actually encouraging a party to breach their contractual obligations by circumventing anti-tethering measures. Will carriers ever sue a site for hosting such information? There's been no sign they will, yet, but as paid tethering becomes more ingrained into the mobile data payment structure, and the majority of Americans start to see it as part of &quot;cell phone service,&quot; I imagine they'll start taking some kind of action. Speaking from the carrier's point of view (not that I agree with it), they'd compare it to posting an FAQ on how to send unlimited text messages, using the carrier's SMS, while hiding that information from the carrier (if that were possible - it's just a hypothetical). Obviously, this would be seen as &quot;stealing service.&quot; I think in the future, C&amp;D letters may start popping up in inboxes of websites that post tethering circumvention methods, but who knows what the carriers will do, or when they'll do it. EDIT: There's probably also related FCC regulations that might apply here, though the fact that it's mobile internet that you're &quot;stealing&quot; makes it unclear to me just how those regulations might be used here, if at all. You'd have to ask a telecom lawyer."
596,"I would tend to agree. Go ahead and start hitting that ""edit"" link. I have updated the tag-wiki for pc to direct people to more specific tags. It might help."
2036,"I wouldn't say ""nothing relevant in common"" as Matthew put it (especially with MTK, which has its specifics). But what I agree with: This site is for end-users, and the majority of end-users probably has no clue whether their device features a mt6582 or rk3066 chip – and if they do, they can specify such in the question's text. A tag is not very useful if ignored by the majority even if it would fit – so I agree with Matthew we don't want/need those on an end-user site (it would look different if we were a techie-centric site, sure)."
2225,"This site is for Android users.  As a rule of thumb, do not ask any question where the question does not come from the perspective of an end user doing end user things. Marketing and charging money are obviously related, but are distinct concepts; you can do one without the other.  So whether your app is free is not relevant, and asking for feedback absolutely counts as ""market research"". As Eldarerathis notes, we also do not accept open-ended polling or anything of that kind.  Questions should be specific and should require answers that can be determined to be correct or not &mdash; not just an opinion, like feedback."
