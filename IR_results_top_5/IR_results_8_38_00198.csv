The automated chat link will also create a public room, so from that regard it's essentially the same (and you can give it whatever title you want). One downside is that the auto-inserted link will import the comments from the post into the chat room when it's created. Creating your own room beforehand will not do this, but if you are pre-emptively setting up a chat with someone then there is likely not going to be a long comment thread to import anyway, I'd imagine.

At the same time, SE also notifies the browser how many updates there are by setting the badge text. Browsers that support badge notification (e.g. Vivaldi, also pinned tabs on Chrome in the past) will show the number of updates on the tab if possible (Vivaldi), or otherwise show a static indicator (pinned tabs on Chrome in the past)."
