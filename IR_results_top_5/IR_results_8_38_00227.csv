2089,"I too think it is pretty much off-topic. Example 1: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one should I buy? We simply can't know the expectations and parameters of choice of any person. Example 2: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one is
better? Since utility of a good is not quantifiable, the answers are going to be pretty much subjective and opinion-based. Example 3: I want a phone with following specs: blablabla Can you guys suggest any? There are websites that find phones with the desired specs already."
1365,"Done.  I'm going to double check right now for any ""remote access"" questions that might need to be retagged. Edit: remote-control and remote-access are still a bit messy.  I'm not sure if we should merge them or what.  I don't think there are many questions about using devices as TV remotes so fortunately that isn't complicating things :)"
1566,"Maybe de-synonym remote-desktop for Android-controlling-non-Android and use remote-access for controlling-Android-from-anything. Also, perhaps remote-control could be repurposed for questions regarding the IR emitters some devices (Samsung GS4 and Galaxy Mega, HTC One, LG Optimus G Pro, etc.) are starting to include."

AnDevCon was OK, but I was pretty disappointed in it as an advanced Android user/developer. Might need to look to some more general conferences such as MADExpo which I saw advertised on MSDN. After a conference is found, finding a speaker shouldn't be a problem: there are plenty of Android fans and developers with plenty to say."
1563,"I would agree to merging them. remote-control is described as as: Remotely control your Android device from any other device/computer,
  or vice versa. remote-access is described as: Methods to remotely access a device from another device, where at
  least one of the two should be running Android. Interestingly, remote-desktop is a synonym of remote-access, which makes it even more confusing if Al Everett describes remote-control as seeing the ""desktop"". UPDATE #1: However, we could probably make a distinction between: However, the second point may be useless, given that it may be via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc"
