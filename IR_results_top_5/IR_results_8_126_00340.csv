860,This if fine by me. Martin covers all the points I was going to say. Pass on over the good questions. :)
14,"I'm going to say that this depends on how specific it is.  At the least, it should be community wiki.  If it isn't specific enough, then it should be closed."
2411,"I don't think there's any way to get a notification, but after a question is migrated, the original question gets a banner to say what site it was migrated to, with a link to the question on the destination site."
633,"I'm getting one and hope to be asking questions here.  Bryan and GAThrawn have explained why. A minor note: Until it's actually released, I expect we won't be accepting questions about it &mdash; the only ones we could answer with certitude pertain to the information Amazon has publicly released.  Just like with Ice Cream Sandwich, we won't speculate or post answers that say ""go look at this thing Eric Schmidt / Jeff Bezos said""; premature questions generally get closed. Just something to keep in mind before you migrate :)"
