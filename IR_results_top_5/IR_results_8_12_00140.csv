1333,"Minor edits should come with added value, like rephrasing the sentences or titles so that they are clearer or easier to understand, adding formatting, or editing the tags where applicable. Minor wrong spellings are where we need to think twice on editing. Sometimes, they are  forgivable, sometimes not. But removing ""thanks"" and ""regards"" alone is TOO minor. As for gaming the system, I agree with the others. These points are too small to be an issue. If this was the motivation alone, then it's not worth the effort. Better things can be done with people's time. So, we should appreciate these types of users who are active in keeping the community clean. [You would want this kind off community in Foursquare] Although we have enough moderators and high-rep members who can do these tasks better, these types of users are better off working on more important moderating tasks. At the end, though, we should strive to make things easier to read / understand."
1812,"All the close reasons count as one ""type of flag"" for this purpose. If you've VTC'ed or flagged with a close reason, you can't VTC or flag again with a close reason, even if it's a different reason. The spam and offensive flags work in the same way: if you've flagged as spam, you can't also flag as offensive, but you can still VTC or flag with a close reason."
1973,"After discussing with two to three people and posting this type of question, I found that  No one has any objection on these type of question.  Since it is not possible for all to know about the file standard of android these type of questions will be helpful for people like me. I wanted to know where the saved wifi-passwords are stored and I got an answer from this SE site and therefore I wanted to know about the other files stores in same directory as that of the file which contained the saved wifi passwords.  So this type of questions can be helpful this way. Best Regards, Jasser"
796,"The problem here is that question's topic doesn't have anywhere currently that it would belong within the StackExchange network. For Android.SE, the relevant section of our FAQ is: What kind of questions can I ask here? Please note the following topics are expressly off-topic here: It's the last (of my quoted) bullet points that's important. This site is for users of Android, the question was about publishing an app in the Market, that's not a user topic. Discussions on these parts of the FAQ are primarily here FAQ: “What kind of questions should I ask here?” and FAQ: “What kind of questions should I NOT ask here?” As for StackOverflow, their FAQ says: Frequently Asked Questions What kind of questions can I ask here? Stack Overflow is for professional and enthusiast programmers, people
who write code because they love it. We feel the best Stack Overflow
questions have a bit of source code in them, but if your question
generally covers … This question isn't covered by any of those question types, so they're not going to accept the question if it's migrated back. Arguably they should never have migrated it here, but just closed it there, but not every mod knows the exact scope of every other site and mistakes are unfortunately made. There is a proposal on the Are 51 site to create a StackExchange site dedicated to App Stores, if that proposal gets enough support, and the site is created, then that would be the natural home for this question. Until that day, it appears that unfortunately there is currently no good home for the question."
1121,I just want to add to Matthew's answer that I think that the confusion comes with the fact that it's hard for the average user to distinguish between an Activity and a Service running in background. We have two questions Both a very similar. Yet there are not really exact duplicates. That is why my solution would be to reopen the first question of type 2 and close either this one or Scott's question as duplicate and merge the answer(s).
