1577,"4.3 hasn't seen much action (it hasn't been long), but the questions for 4.1 and 4.2 each have over 20k views. By comparison, the average question got less than 1.8k views in the last year (my calculation assumes no older questions got views, which is obviously wrong). There are definitely problems with these questions but besides being massive drivers of traffic, they're also pretty highly voted.  People want them. I see the direction Google is going, but I don't think we should follow suit until our audience does."
1936,"The more appropriate close reason for the current and previous revision of the post might be ""primarily opinion based"". You could argue that one could collect statistics about which manufacturers upgrade the most often, and so on, but it's a rather complicated endeavor.  Within specific time periods and device lines you're going to find wildly different information, and none of it is useful going forward because there are simply no set-in-stone policies here.  We want questions to be useful to future readers without their answers needing to be revised all the time. Ultimately it still seems like a shopping advice question, or at least suffers from the same issues as those questions. I can't comment on the views of the other mods, but upon logging in today I found that all of them had viewed your post and declined to take action which is why I dismissed your flag."
1682,"The +100 rep association bonus is not counted in the protection algorithm. The post notice states (emphasis added): To answer it, you must have earned at least 10 reputation on this site. and the ""on this site"" part is actually quite literal, though not entirely clear. Therefore, looking at your rep history, you've got +100 for the association bonus and +5 for an upvote on one of your questions. That nets you 5 rep from your activities on this site, which is still shy of the 10 needed. There is also a more detailed explanation of the ""protected"" status on Meta Stack Exchange, for reference. In this specific case, the view count of the question is pretty low, so I'm going to remove the protection. It looks like it was applied because it picked up a bunch of non-answers within the first 24 hours, but then the views petered off after that."
1536,"The rep required to view the First Posts review queue was bumped from 125 rep to 500 rep on July 26th. You had enough rep to view it under the old rules but do not any longer. The original suggestion, along with some of the reasons why the SE team chose to move this to 500 rep, can be found in this answer on MSO."
2459,"Judging by the number of low-quality deleted answers on this question, it's just a question that has been high in Google search results for a long time. Such questions are most likely to attract spam answers because spammers want to attack the pages that get most views, or that show up in searches for their spam keywords. You'll notice some similarities between the ""helpful"" content of the spam answers - most likely, both were copied from the same source of generic advice. The third post you quote is the same kind of spam comment you can see on any blog nowadays."
