1770,"Click your avatar in the top bar to visit your profile page. If it says ""more info"" at the top, next to your username, click that. Where it says ""helpful flags"" and then a number, click on the number. On that page, you can see your flagging history, including the status/response of each flag (whether it's still awaiting review, or was judged to be helpful or unhelpful). Alternatively, you can just type in the URL but replacing ""12442"" with your user ID (the number that shows in all URLs about your profile)."
1252,"I am in the GMT time zone and things seem synced up, so I would say it's on the GMT/UTC time. Also, at the bottom of your data box (when you hover over your username on the top bar), it gives the UTC time. However, I think winterba.sh is a number of hours ahead..."
448,"That list is generated at website startup by picking from the top 20 tags at random. If you see things in the list you don't like, that's a strong sign that elements of the site's tagging are broken. If you need us to press the magic ""make it as if this tag never existed"" button, just let me know."
773,"I was a little disappointed when I opened this and discovered that I will not be receiving free ice cream sandwiches all week, but this idea is neat, too. One suggestion: Could we enforce some kind of minimum question score in order to be eligible for any drawings? Entering everybody would allow people to post really bad questions like ""Why is ICS so AWESOME!"" just to get an entry. I'd be inclined to say that only questions with a score greater than zero should be eligible (so at least someone else thought it was a good question). (I also realize this would be a bit different than the Kindle Fire contest, where it appeared that people with zero score posts were entered into the drawing provided that no other answers on the question were upvoted)"
2285,"This close reason is designed to let people know not to ask about general phone issues or generic hardware issues, rather than the much broader ""something not in scope"".  We get quite a lot of these questions, and approximately 0.1% of their askers bother to read the help center.  A slightly larger number read the close reason, so I'd say it's helpful. We also tend to get people who argue based on things like ""well I'm using an Android phone with Sprint, so Sprint's coverage areas are relevant!"" and this shuts them down much more effectively than the help center. Unless you have an idea for a more useful close reason to take the spot of this one, I don't see any reason to take action to remove it."
