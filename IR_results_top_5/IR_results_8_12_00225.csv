581,"I guess I fall into the ""middle class"" type of user (at the moment). I like to think I'm being generally helpful and contributing, but there's definitely a large, empty gap in the middle rep ranges which I've wondered about for a while. I'm going to go ahead and throw out a couple of things I've personally observed which have a negative impact on the number of available answerable questions. I don't claim any kind of statistical backing to any of this, mind you: That said, I also think that it's somewhat hard to attract real power users to a Q&amp;A site like this. Now I'm not saying we can't or that we should give up because I really enjoy having Android Enthusiasts around, but the nature of the beast is that much of what happens on e.g. XDA is very discussion based. There's a lot of trial and error, people experimenting with things and almost bricking their phones then collaborating on solutions, and developers putting out bleeding-edge stuff for others to test and give feedback on. We just can't cater to that here, and I think it does affect our userbase to some extent. Is it necessarily a bad thing? No, I don't think so. I'm personally glad to be able to come here when I have a question so that I can ask it without it getting lost in a sea of discussion and just get answers. I do think that it's a little bit of a handicap, though. That turned out to be a bit more lengthy than I intended, but that's my $0.02."
178,"I have two concerns. One, ""intrusive"" is very subjective. What's intrusive for you may not be a big deal for someone else. Second, and more important, is that I think it's too ambitious and doesn't fit in with this site. The number of tablets is going to grow exponentially and, unless someone is really dedicated, your proposed wiki will never be able to keep up. Once it gets out of date by more than a couple months, it will have lost most of its utility. Plus it has the potential to get really huge. This is the sort of thing that Wikipedia does well. Let them. "
2043,"All Stack Exchange sites are manned by the same company, and are run by essentially the same engine, with some additional per-site customizations like MathJax, etc. The new navigation is coming to all of them; this isn't really a subject for discussion. New interface is being tested on SO first, since the guiding principle of the company is to figure out what developers need, and then provide that thing to others. "
1066,"I am undecided. This are two different things, although there are  very few  questions. I would let them separated for a while and see how things go."
860,This if fine by me. Martin covers all the points I was going to say. Pass on over the good questions. :)
