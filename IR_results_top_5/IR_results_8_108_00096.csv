2376,"In most cases, there's no requirement before you can ask or answer. Some questions are protected because they attract a lot of new users to add useless answers like Thank you or Me too, so they got a special handling, that they're made to require 10 reputation for the user before answering. 10 is a considerably low threshold, because 1 upvote on an answer gains you that much. According to statictics, new users tend to generate content of a lower quality, so Stack Exchange decided to add more restrictions, especially rate-limiting to new users. It's also good that you get to learn something before asking. There's already a bunch of rare questions solved and good answers posted, which can solve your problem in most cases without you having to ask again. Reference from Meta Stack Exchange FAQ: What does it mean for a question to be protected?
  Protected questions have the additional restriction that new users are not permitted to answer the question.  Unlike locked questions, they can still be edited, commented on, and voted on.  You can even vote to close them. Why are some questions protected?
  Questions are usually protected because they have attracted either spam answers or ""noisy"" answers such as ""thank you"", ""this worked for me"", or ""I'm also having this problem"" from new users who may mistake the site as a traditional forum. Asking
  - Users with &lt; 125 rep, 40 minutes since their last question anywhere on the network (This applies to the user's IP address, not their account. If the user shares that IP with other users, they can be limited by the other user asking a question anywhere on the network.)"
80,Jeff Atwood nuked the Android tag.  I re-tagged questions that were left as untagged.   I'm not sure if this means users still be able to add new questions with the tag or not.
1105,"Converting Zuul's ""clicker happy"" to ""trigger happy"", I'd like to see the old system available even when the last queue was converted, as I already explained with a post on meta (Is there a way to access the older review tools for processing the edit queue?). While feeling comfortable with the new system when it comes to close-votes, I prefer the old system for some of the others: There I can pick the questions I feel I can do something about, leaving the others completely untouched (so I can even return to them later, which is not possible with the new system). Don't get me wrong: the new system has its advantages. But so has the old... My favorite quote here again: As it stands now, I rarely touch the edit queue unless I'm really bored because I don't want to have to wade through a ton of questions that I can't necessarily help with. This I can easier avoid with the old system. Add a possibility to filter by tag, or to suppress unwanted tags (such as favorite tags and ignored tags in the questions section, or even just honoring those in the review section), so it will even help when we get bigger ;)"
622,"Frankly, I think questions like this should be closed as ""too localized"", but I'm afraid we're going to keep getting them. They're way too localized. Even a question like ""what's new in Android 4.0?"" would be marginal (I'd point them to Wikipedia, I look up what's new in each Google Chrome release on Wikipedia for example). An 2.3.x release on a specific phone model (I'm assuming vendors tweak each release?) is incredibly localized and trivial."
1635,Tags and their structure are very site specific. A user should have some knowledge on how a site does organize its tags in order to create new one. That's one reason why you need 300 rep here and why it doesn't matter what position or how much rep you have on other sites.
