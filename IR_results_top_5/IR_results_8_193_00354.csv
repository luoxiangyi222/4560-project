1792,"As for the extra 1 you haven't accounted for: every user starts with one reputation point, not zero."
2387,"The bounty amount is deducted from your reputation when the bounty starts, not when it's awarded. For the particular example you mentioned, you can see exactly what happened on the reputation tab of that user's profile. They started with 1 like everyone else, got +100 of association bonus, and then spent it on the bounty to get back to 1 rep. They also got an upvote on the question taking them up to 6. Spending one's association bonus to bounty one's first question on a new site is pretty common but it's quite unfortunate, because you have to get all the way back up to 110 reputation before you can answer protected questions."
90,You start with 1 reputation point. If you link your user account to an account on another Stack Exchange site you get a free 100 point bonus. Thus 101 reputation without asking any questions or giving any answers. Update: Note that the account you link to has to have a minimum amount of reputation itself (200+) or you don't get the bonus. The thinking is that if you're a good contributor on another site that will likely be true on this one as well.  Linked account didn&#39;t get 100 rep points
596,"I would tend to agree. Go ahead and start hitting that ""edit"" link. I have updated the tag-wiki for pc to direct people to more specific tags. It might help."
2165,"One factor nobody has mentioned yet: an answer that says, ""you have to modify the ROM to do it"" could well lead someone (the questioner, or someone else who sees the answer) who has never tried making ROMs to start doing it. Or it could lead to a ROM developer adding that feature to their ROM. Or, in this particular case, someone might see it and realise that a particular ROM already has that feature. I think those all sound like good outcomes. ROM developers don't just spring into existence fully formed: they're just users with problems who try to learn something to solve them. I'm generally quite happy with an answer that leads people into a non-end-user solution, as long as we don't start scaring people off."
