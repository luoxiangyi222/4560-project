2199,"There's no point flagging such comments. Flags are seen by moderators, not the comment author, and moderators don't have any special power to make comments into answers. I think it would be really useful to have a special kind of ""this comment should be an answer"" flag, which goes straight to the comment author, but we don't have such a thing. The only sensible course of action is to reply to the comment to suggest that the comment is a helpful answer and if posted as an answer, it would be easier for people to find and that you would vote up that answer. I've emphasized three parts of that, for the following reason. Remember that everyone here is acting voluntarily. We can't force anyone to write an answer, and there's no obligation for people to write full posts. People contribute because they want to help others, and for recognition from other people via the site's reputation system. It's important not to act like someone has short-changed you by making their suggestion in a comment instead of an answer, or like you're entitled to a full post. For that reason, I think it's important to be honest that you're asking a favour of the author. The three important parts of the favour-asking are (a) showing that you appreciate what they've already done; (b) showing how writing an answer is even more helpful than what they've already done; and (c) showing how writing an answer will earn them recognition from the community. I know it's hard to be as encouraging as a kindergarten teacher all of the time. Certainly on occasion when I've been having a bad day and I know that whatever comment I write will be mean and sarcastic instead of encouraging, I've simply ignored the answer-as-comment instead of trying to get the author to fix it. I'd encourage anyone on the site to do the same if they feel that writing a suggestion with my three points is too much work, or is draining, and if they feel tempted to write a rude message asking someone . There are many reasons why answers-in-comments are bad for the site, but none of those is worth alienating users for. So although I said the only sensible course of action is to reply to the comment, your ""do nothing"" option can also be sensible sometimes. As a community we pride ourselves on picking up litter, but sometimes it's OK to just leave one for someone else to find."
1202," Liam W answered:  Very good question. I would suggest to them that they continue their answering, but ensure they think about their comments before they post them. I would recommend that as a valued contributor (to answers), they should know the rules. I would ask them to follow them, and then I may have to resort to drastic measures (times suspensions etc).  Flow answered:  Depends on the type of comments he leaves. I never encountered that case on AN.SX. But if I agree with the comments, which is likely if it's a big amount of flags, I would contact him and ask him to stop that behaviour. I like the friendly and polite tone on SX and would like to keep it that way.  Suraj Bajaj answered:  Well, wherever I find any such comment I will act on it. Ask them to be careful and be friendly with users. Everyone's opinion matters but it has to be put in the right way. It hardly matters how much rep you have if you don't know how to behave."
1673,"On-hold or closed questions still have a useful purpose for the site: to serve as an example to others. Every on-hold question (for whatever reason) is an example of what kinds of question we don't want on the site. If a new visitor arrives at the site, looks at existing questions, and notices that (for example) a question about programming has been put on hold, and reads the reason, he'll learn two things: first, that we aren't Yahoo! Answers, and what happens if a question isn't appropriate for the site; second, that if he asks a programming question, it'll be put on hold too. It's an important part of the feedback process, cultivating the community of people interested in the same topic. This is why closed questions aren't hidden from the front page (unless they have a very negative score) or deleted right away. (This is only part of the reason. Deleting them right away would stop the author improving or refining the question so it can be reopened.) There's another side of this: often, when a voter leaves a ""this is off-topic"" comment, the questioner will delete their question right away, without even waiting for it to be put on hold. They're probably trying to be polite and a good netizen: deleting the question after being told it's inappropriate. This is a shame, for two reasons. It defeats the mechanism described above, so we'll end up with more people asking questions that don't fit the site. In addition, sometimes this happens with questions that are borderline, or where the commenter has misunderstood, so the question would not be put on hold. It might even have been an asset to the site had the author not deleted it. For these reasons, I'd like to encourage close-voters to only leave an ""off-topic"" comment in unambiguous cases, to reduce that risk; and I'd also ask those who can't vote-to-close yet to refrain from leaving such comments, and flag the question for a more experienced user to discuss."
1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
142,"Treat it like any other answer. Leave a comment about the error to urge the author to correct it and to alert others. There's a common fallacy about the ""accepted answer;"" that its means it was selected as the ""right"" answer or the ""best"" answer. Accepted answer means only that it was the post that best helped the author of the question. Nothing more. It's unfortunate that the answer happened to be incorrect (easily remedied as I described above) but there's nothing to be done about changing the author's personal choice."
