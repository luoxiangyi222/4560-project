818,We definitely can't reproduce this. Did you try disabling any Chrome extensions you are using? Did you modify any of the default browser settings?
171,"I'm trying to add this to (regular, non-hosted) gmail. I haven't added a lot of widgets, and I'm stumped the gadget URL is  It shows up, but is empty  and the gadgets settings tells me I need to configure an ID (of course)... but I can't find a way to configure the ID.  Does this not work for gmail -- which otherwise accepts gadgets --, or can I configure it?"
1026,"I'd like to add this thought, as per the linky in the above comment, I did think the question was rogue, but who am I to judge?! I could be very well wrong on that type of question asked, and my thinking was ""Was that a very deceptive social-engineering ploy to extract information?"" but I digress. Obviously, the line needs to be drawn, perhaps, by limiting the answer to those type of questions with a certain reputation level maybe? i.e. if the question posed, is of a nature where it elicits an answer that involves a form of hacking or exploiting the handset, whether benign intentions or unintentional (as in ""Whoops I fouled up and now I cannot get into my handset""), a reputation of say 5,000 can view the answer as a result of gaining that level of trust by the community! But on the other hand, if an answer is posted for all to see, it WILL be abused and misused for whatever exploitation techniques regardlessly for whatever reasons that would be outside of the domain of the community.  That question, meanwhile was bizarre to say the least! But refrained from answering publicly in case it turns out to be false, i.e. Was it a stolen handset and that the OP was trying to extract data from it but then again, the OP did dodge it by back-tracking over the gmail and switched tactics about yahoo mail hence the comments in the said question.

This entails more effort than a modified link, but produces better results."
212,"The search engine answer seems the most likely. I know that when I've done a quick Google on answers for some of the slightly obscure questions here, the question itself often shows up in the top 5 Google results. Also, have a look at the questions with the most views, like the Galaxy S GPS problems one. These have thousands of views, and lots of replies from users with just one rep point, that smacks of people who've just found the page through a search engine when they're trying to find the solution to a problem they're having, but aren't sticking around and using the rest of the site."
