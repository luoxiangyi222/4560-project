1973,"After discussing with two to three people and posting this type of question, I found that  No one has any objection on these type of question.  Since it is not possible for all to know about the file standard of android these type of questions will be helpful for people like me. I wanted to know where the saved wifi-passwords are stored and I got an answer from this SE site and therefore I wanted to know about the other files stores in same directory as that of the file which contained the saved wifi passwords.  So this type of questions can be helpful this way. Best Regards, Jasser"
580,"A few projects in the works that may remediate some of these concerns: Improving the algorithm that controls the official Twitter account so that it brings better content and value to followers. Building relationships with mobile &amp; Android blogs for upcoming collaborations (You will soon see an ad for Android Guys in the sidebar + an upcoming program that will ""port"" over our Android release calendar wiki to Android Guys and other outside sites - Please let me know if you know someone else who wants to host this release calendar). Contests! - This relates to both bullets above. Expect a giveaway in the near future executed through Twitter/Facebook in collaboration with an outside Android and/or mobile site. Any other ideas? Further questions? Also, does anyone have a connection at a major Android manufacturer who can help me get a hold of a Thrill, Bionic, Vigor or Galaxy S II?"
2089,"I too think it is pretty much off-topic. Example 1: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one should I buy? We simply can't know the expectations and parameters of choice of any person. Example 2: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one is
better? Since utility of a good is not quantifiable, the answers are going to be pretty much subjective and opinion-based. Example 3: I want a phone with following specs: blablabla Can you guys suggest any? There are websites that find phones with the desired specs already."
1028,"The interesting thing is how many questions of this kind are asked by first-timers (feels like 95% up). It's rarely one with rep coming up with such a question. Next interesting fact is how often the OP shows up afterwards: I'd say 80% up do never show up again, 10% just on the very first day to prove their point and destroy doubts, if possible. Which makes it quite suspicious. Don't take me wrong: The information is freely available if you know the sources, you don't even have to identify yourself to get it. That's why I'd say ""big fish"" never turns up like that (""big fish"" not only knows where the food is, but also ""how to get the crab out of its shell""). So what's left must be either ""small fish"" (those who just ""found"" a single device -- which is not worth the big research and maybe little to big monetary investment), and people of ""legitimate interest"". Not being interested in the former, this leaves the latter. Who are they? People like t0mm13b, who are simply technically interested, or willing to help ""friends in need"" (i.e. people they know). These usually already have a higher rep -- and I see no reason to hide things from them. But then there's the last remaining group: those without any rep, who just f***ed off their device (in this case -- call me bad -- it's a good point to start learning not to fiddle with things you don't understand -- or to be more careful with your sensitive stuff, sorry), or in fact had ""bad stuff happening"" (the brothers little daughter playing with the... how did she get her hands on it?). So my opinion on this: I go with t0mm13b. If technically possible, real sensitive stuff should require a certain rep (at least 1,000+). Everybody below that level could still get the ""obvious legitimate solutions"", such as to specify their Google credentials on a messed-up pattern lock, or see their local Rabbi1... oops, service technician. If it's really your device, you have the papers to prove -- and the solution to your problem is reached faster when taking those papers and looking up a service point (you can return successfully just within minutes) but to prove the legitimacy to ""us"". If it's really a legitimate thing, (s)he will do so. For a petty thief, even this little effort will be too much -- and if it requires more afford, (s)he probably doesn't find it as worth the next time. 1SYLOR is the term for getting sensitive information on e.g. our judaism stack (See Your Local Orthodox Rabbi. Meaning: This is real sensitive (and maybe personal) stuff which should be explained by an expert face-to-face: He can identify you and tell you what you really should know -- as opposed to what you say you need to know -- guess you get my point."
2363,"This site isn't a forum. There aren't ""follow-ups"" here: there are questions and answers. If you want to ask a question, use the Ask question button. If you know the answer to a question, write it in Your answer under that question. It doesn't matter how relevant it is: if it's not an answer to the question, it doesn't belong there. People who know the answer to your question won't see it if it's not posted as a question, and they can't help you, because you can't answer an answer. Running the site in this format is what makes it a repository of information that's easy to find and navigate, without the problems of thread hijacking and ""me too"" posts that you get on a forum. It means that people who know about the thing you're asking about will see your question on the front page of the site: you're not relying on them looking on the n-th page of a thread about a related question that they're not going to look at because they already know the answer. The tour is a really brief introduction to all of this. You get a badge for reading it, but more importantly, you also learn how to get your questions answered by experts."
