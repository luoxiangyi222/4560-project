606,"I've thought about this some more, and I think we had a bit of a shift after the site went public.  Though I won't point them out, there were a few highly active users I can think of who largely disappeared after that. I'm not sure why that happened, but I do wonder if it's related to the rep requirements suddenly doubling.  I was about to hit 10k rep then (Trusted User) and it was a bit of a shock when I realized I was going to have to duplicate my entire performance so far just in order to get back where I was before, since now Trusted User is 20k rep. That must have been immensely discouraging for some users.  Maybe now we're just waiting for new users to come up and fill the middle tier that was suddenly vacated by the change in rep requirements? I'm not sure it makes sense to have the same rep requirements as a huge site like SO either.  I would happily trust GAThrawn or eldarerathis, for example, with the 10k tools.  Their work flagging and close-voting is immensely useful and they have great judgment.  We don't require mods to have 20k rep before making them mods, right?  I'm the only one over 20k and I just got there recently! Maybe we already have a middle class, and we're just not making effective use of them."
2152,"This is likely a result of how Area 51 instructs users proposing a new site. We're creating sites for experts. Your site should focus on pilots, not passengers; lawyers, not lawbreakers; professional photographers, not Uncle Marv with his digital point-n-shoot. If the site can attract the experts, the amateur enthusiasts will follow! So, the box &quot;This site is for ____&quot; gets filled accordingly, and then used for the tour of the site. Regular folks arrive later and eventually become the majority of visitors. At this point the tour may need an update."
1378,In this case I think you should feel free to ask a separate question since the devices obviously have different features for this.  Bonus points if you link to the existing question and mention why you're asking the new one.
985,"I do agree that a little improvement needs to be performed on some of the lightest grey's used. I mainly use Firefox 13.0.1 under Ubuntu 12.04, and with my recently acquired ASUS VE228 LED Monitor, I have some trouble recognizing some of the lightest grey colors currently being used. Using Firebug, I've analyzed and collected some information regarding tags or classes that apply a light grey as a background color for a visual representation: #F4F4F4 is hard to see .post-tag class currently using #F4F4F4 This class is used on on regular tags. e.g., hard-to-see #F3F3F3 is hard to see code tag currently using #F3F3F3  This tag is used on inline code, when we wrap something around a `. e.g., I'm inline highlighted code pre tag currently using #F3F3F3 This tag is used when we either press ctrl + k or use the toolbar button . e.g., #F6F6F6 is hard to see, with considerations .owner class currently using #F6F6F6 This class is used for the background of a users signature. Note:
Since the rectangle for a user signature has a respectable size, it's easier to notice the color difference between the white background and the signature background. #EEEEEE works very well blockquote tag currently using #EEEEEE This tag is used when we either press ctrl + q or use the toolbar button . e.g., I'm a quote block In order to properly understand if this was an issue of my newly acquired monitor, or a overall situation, I've performed some tests (opening and navigating the  page) using difference OSâ€™s and monitors. Here's the conclusions: Windows XP Professional Version 2002 SP3 | ASUS VE228 LED Monitor Browsers used: Result obtained: equal results on all browsers My conclusion for the tests performed is that under optimal color calibration conditions, the light grey's used are hard to distinguish from the white background. It gets really hard when we're reading a paragraph with some inline code, because at first glance I can't spot it. The code-block fails only if we are reading a single line of code. When two or more lines are used, it is reasonable visible, just like the background color for the user signature. Windows 7 Home Edition SP1 | Toshiba Laptop - Satellite C660 (built-in monitor) Browsers used: Result obtained: equal results on all browsers My Toshiba doesn't have any color calibration applied, since I don't perform any graphical design with it. The sole purpose for this laptop is the test of work being developed, just like a client would see it, so, everything is by default across the system. Here, It appears to work well on all browsers on all colors tested. Naturally that the light grey is more like a blueish color than actually a tone from black-to-white. So I can't really rely on this as to a positive assessment, I'll consider it a false-positive. Every grey color currently used below the tone provided by #EEEEEE can't stand out if used on small areas. Some improvements are noted if used of considerably large areas. The #EEEEEE works well for calibrated an non calibrated working environments. Have the following colors updated to a slightly dark tone: This assessment was performed with a Linux tool called Agave. I've used the tool color piker and picked the colors from examples provided on this answer. Then, I've lowered the tone by one, and the result provided was far more visible then the one picked.  HTML color code is placed on the lower right side of the color rectangle Using Agave color picker on this image, I did get the correct code for each rectangle picked. There seems to be no distinction between the colors in use or proposed colors when placed side by side respectively. All three used colors side by side are visually equal. Same goes for the ones suggested. As a side note: one may consider using just one color to replace the three being used."
