1300,"We had similar questions like this one on meta before. We already have such a development tag, but it's not really successful in preventing from dev questions pooping up. Liam's idea seems sophisticated but is also complex and not easy to implement. (Also note that it's already possible to blacklist tags). But all in all I think the ""vote close review queue"" does the job pretty will. It seldom takes longer then a day, mostly just a few hours, before a development question is closed. I think that's the best we can get atm without doing some fancy stuff that may be not usable along the other sites."
8,"Unless/until the Android Developers suggestion at Area 51 takes off, I think SO should be used for development questions."
312,"We can now at least use direct links to Market apps that use a normal URL scheme and will work as links on both the phone and your PC.  No need to use a market://.... link, we can use   Eg this link should take you to the app's Market page on a normal web browser, and if clicked from an Android browser should take you into the app's page in the Market app:  What's more the Android market web pages even have a QR code on them. Anyone know if there'd be a problem embedding the QRs from the Market server in here, they use the normal Ggoogle Charts API to create the QR, like this: |0&amp;cht=qr&amp;chl=http%3A%2F%2Fmarket.android.com%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.rovio.angrybirds Which in an image link gives us:  Which should all be a lot more useful (and less confusing to the casual visitor) than sending someone to Appbrain, or the like."
1490,"I think it might be beneficial to make the wording of the first one more broadly applicable than just ""software development questions"". Something like: Questions about writing and publishing Android apps, writing custom ROMs, and other topics that are primarily of concern to developers are off-topic. Consider taking advantage of other resources that may be appropriate for your question. The reason I'm inclined to link to Where can I ask questions that aren&#39;t Android Enthusiast questions? instead of SO directly is that there are things in that statement (publishing and such) that SO would likely close as well."
1303,"It won't work. Like we all do with EULAs, they'll tick the box without reading and keep going.  If there's any fanciness like a timer or making sure they scroll the page, they'll just cheat it and still not read it. There are already lots of pointers to the FAQ and asking guidelines when you post here for the first time.  (Log out and take a look!)  We can do our best to make sure that content is available and helpful, but we can't do anything about the users who refuse to make use of it. See also: Add &quot;I have read the FAQ&quot; check box to the Ask Question page among many others."
