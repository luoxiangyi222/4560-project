1973,"After discussing with two to three people and posting this type of question, I found that  No one has any objection on these type of question.  Since it is not possible for all to know about the file standard of android these type of questions will be helpful for people like me. I wanted to know where the saved wifi-passwords are stored and I got an answer from this SE site and therefore I wanted to know about the other files stores in same directory as that of the file which contained the saved wifi passwords.  So this type of questions can be helpful this way. Best Regards, Jasser"
1363,"I respect that you want help others with re-opening your question. However our FAQ states that ""shopping recommendations"" are off-topic on Android Enthusiasts.  In fact all type of recommendations do not fit your Q/A format. A better approach would be something like the already existing question ""Where can I find a comparison of Android devices?"". The answers of this question also provide an answer to your question and the question is within the rules of our FAQ. I personally can only recommend geekaphone: It allows the comparison of different smartphones including the Apple ones."
254,It may also be helpful to enumerate what type of devices are on-topic. What about e-book readers? The B&amp;N Nook is based on Android. (None of the others currently on the market is Android.) Google TV is built on Android. I'm actually surprised we haven't gotten any questions about it already. Is it allowed?
2308,"I use Arch Linux, and have instaled ttf-google-fonts-git. Roboto has always been a part of the package. But the site still looks awful on my computer. When I was typing this as a comment, I couldn't see what I'm typing well enough. Though I can see this just fine when typing in the Answer section.  If you must use Roboto, please use Roboto-Medium or Roboto-Regular instead of thin or light variants. The site is currently unusable for me. And please set up fallbacks for people who don't have Roboto."
817,"How many questions of this type are we talking about? How many questions are migrated from here to SO on a daily basis? This would be a fair amount of work, and I'd need to know that it's because there are 10+ questions of this type. Often for low volume stuff, handling it manually is the best option until the volume increases. It's also a little tricky since the intrinsic tag on this site has to exist on the target site, etc. Looking here:  I see 10 questions going to SO for the month of November."
