Sample tag wiki for the IME tag could be something like: An input method editor is a OS or keyboard component or program that
  allows users to enter characters and symbols not found on their
  keyboard. For instance this allows the user of a Latin keyboard to
  input Chinese, Japanese, Korean or Indic characters."
