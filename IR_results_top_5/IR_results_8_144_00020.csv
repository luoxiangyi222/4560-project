1223,"I agree with Al on file-folders and home-screen-folders. I also agree with not needing a separate tag for the mail folders (the email tag should be sufficient here). Number 4 (gallery) are in practice most likely filesystem folders (except when tags would be represented as folders). I don't think this would need a separate tag. But I'm a bit unsure where a possible synonym ""folders"" should point to. If the mentioned brain-washing would not have taken place, I'd happily agree on Al's suggestion here as well; but even being a MS-abstainer I must admit: on hearing the term ""folder"", my first association are directories, followed by email folders, and only after that the homescreen folders -- so I'm unsure about that. One good thing about that synonym would be to save us from a tag with the same name reappearing, though :)"
917,"The best you can really do currently is to create a new room and then invite the user to that room. You can also leave a link to the room as a comment on their post if you want. The automated chat link will also create a public room, so from that regard it's essentially the same (and you can give it whatever title you want). One downside is that the auto-inserted link will import the comments from the post into the chat room when it's created. Creating your own room beforehand will not do this, but if you are pre-emptively setting up a chat with someone then there is likely not going to be a long comment thread to import anyway, I'd imagine. This has also been discussed on Meta Stack Overflow."
1657,"I would keep the tablet tag. But I would also have kept the phone tag, as I think that there exist questions that are only relevant for phones and tablets. Please don't confuse this with irrelevant tags added to posts. If a question isn't phone specific, there is no need to add the phone tag. Side note: But there is also no big harm in adding it, as long as the tag doesn't occupy the spot for a more relevant one."
2099,"Answers don't determine whether questions are duplicates. If an answer needs updating or another needs to be posted you should do one or all of: However, I'm pretty sure you're not correct about all of those changes since 5.0, since I was able to find and add methods that definitely work on some 5.1 and 6.0 devices.  Try it out. You should also look at my second answer.  This is not supposed to be possible for you to bypass, especially not with a locked bootloader.  That's the entire point of the feature."
1585,"For the most part, we don't need device-specific tags. They lead to overuse. It's pretty rare for an issue that someone is facing to actually be specific to their device. (People should use tags to help categorize their issue, not their device.) I've not seen evidence that there's an overabundance of questions where the distinction between the original Nexus 7 and the newer (2013) model is in anyway important. So, I say: No, we don't need a new tag, nor to rename the old one."
