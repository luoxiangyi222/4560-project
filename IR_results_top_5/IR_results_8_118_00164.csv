860,This if fine by me. Martin covers all the points I was going to say. Pass on over the good questions. :)
14,"I'm going to say that this depends on how specific it is.  At the least, it should be community wiki.  If it isn't specific enough, then it should be closed."
1969,"I'd say the tag is fine, and for those few questions more diversification is not justified. A tag-wiki excerpt could mention the tag is for all devices of the ""Micromax Unite"" brand, while the wiki itself could go into more detail."
1051,"It is a question with a definite, non-subjective answer (as long as you just say what has changed and how, and stay away from saying if it's an actual improvement or now). However it's also very localized in time. The answer is only ever going to be useful for someone with your make/model and firmware version. The number of people with that combination is going to shrink to none over time as people pick up and apply the update. I think that this is probably something that would need to be taken on a question by question basis, and probably only for very major updates (eg 2.3 -> 4), or updates that would affect a lot of devices in the same way (eg a TouchWiz or Sense UI update)."
2232,"I don't know if there is general SE guidance on this, but I would say yes &mdash; clear cut cases seem like a good place for flags.  This site is not at the point where moderators need to heavily triage flags, as yet.  That said, I also go fully through most queues regularly, so a flag is not strictly necessary."
