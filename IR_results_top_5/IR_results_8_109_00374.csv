833,"In addition to the search filtering that Flow mentions, you can also set up ""favorite"" and ""ignored"" tags from the right sidebar on the main page. Ignored tags will be faded grey on the question lists and favorited ones will be highlighted. "
917,"The best you can really do currently is to create a new room and then invite the user to that room. You can also leave a link to the room as a comment on their post if you want. The automated chat link will also create a public room, so from that regard it's essentially the same (and you can give it whatever title you want). One downside is that the auto-inserted link will import the comments from the post into the chat room when it's created. Creating your own room beforehand will not do this, but if you are pre-emptively setting up a chat with someone then there is likely not going to be a long comment thread to import anyway, I'd imagine. This has also been discussed on Meta Stack Overflow."
2164,"There is a precedent here, a programmatic answer to one of my questions  that guided me to flag this answer as NAA ( flag history reveals this as disputed) Simply put, the point here is usefulness of answer Vs Site Guidelines. Making exceptions based on utility of answer invites setting up a precedent.  Hypothetically, if one knew a better way to code and post  alternative answer highlighting that, what should one do? Or, if the OP/ another visitor who also knows coding seeks a clarification? (Agreed, I am stretching possibilities) IMO, it would be more prudent to adhere to site guidelines and I fully support Firelord's view. He has pointed out successful moderator intervention in past, for deletion of such answers There can and should be a discussion on border line cases but not in cases like this where it is clear cut (= it does not belong here) Edit: Another possible instance where non adherence to site guidelines wouldn't help. There are accepted ( commercially implemented  ) solutions pertaining to charging, which are in the nature of shorting some pins or connecting a resistor across some pins to achieve results These work, are useful but do they belong here ? (on this site, as an answer)"
515,"We now have a set a guidelines for Stack Exchange Community blogs, so make sure you check out How are blogs created? for details on getting one for this community."
1387,"I say no. ""Unknown sources"" is (should be) about the setting. ""Sideloading"" is (should be) about the act of installing an app outside of the context of the Market/Play Store/etc. They are related, sure, but I don't think they're the same."
