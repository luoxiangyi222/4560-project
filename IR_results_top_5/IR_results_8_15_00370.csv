238,"Sounds like something that would be quite useful. If it were one App per Answer, then each app could be individually voted up/down as well as comments left against it...so each answer in itself is useful..."

Driveby comments that can be left by anyone are not in our best interest.  You will notice that you don't even need to sign up to post a question or answer, however. Without knowing what question you're referring to or what your comment would be, it's hard to help you further."
1192," Liam W answered:  Comments - to notify that user to try and improve. If I understand what they are on about, the edit button. If after a while, nothing has changed, the close or delete button.  Flow answered:  Edit, downvote or flag. More or less in that order  Suraj Bajaj answered:  Depends. If poorly written, edit button would be my first choice. If argumentative, I would prefer leaving a comment. Down vote would always be my last choice. I would rather try to improve (and ask the author to improve), than just down voting. However, last choice is still a choice! :)"
1053,"If there are tag slots left, tag it with browser and chrome-for-android. If there are no slots left, just use chrome-for-android. I saw some edits here that removed the ""parent tags"". E.g. if something was tagged with usb, tethering usb-tethering, somethingelse usb and tethering was removed. IMHO this is counterproductive. As long as the removed tags are not replaced with some better/important tag(s), just leave it as it is."
