138,"Another thought: I alway link to Appbrain for apps and I'm not going to stop doing that but if you find a solution on another website like Lifehacker, putting a link to the article would be a good idea.  If those sites start getting referrals from android.SE and/or see the back links they may take notice quicker.  "

120,"We might also find great benefit in sharing this with Motorola, Samsung, HTC, etc. on-line communities and forums. I think it would be a great opportunity if we started sharing answers, links, etc. at these places! The idea would be to attract users without harming what they have going on already.

1549,"If you don't take any time to learn anything about the site you're visiting, it's not going to work for you.  Start here. We're not obligated to help you, and we are a community-led site.  Driveby comments that can be left by anyone are not in our best interest.  You will notice that you don't even need to sign up to post a question or answer, however. Without knowing what question you're referring to or what your comment would be, it's hard to help you further."
