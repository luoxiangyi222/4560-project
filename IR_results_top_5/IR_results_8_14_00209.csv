751,"Not sure there. It seems to me that you can talk about one without talking about the other. Can you offer some sample questions where one could be used instead of the other? I expect that there are probably a bunch of questions that are mis-tagged as one instead of the other, but that doesn't necessarily make them synonyms. I don't feel strongly either way, though, so I can be convinced."
716,I'll throw one of my own in: Q: How can I prevent Google Talk from disconnecting? (Jan 2011)
1196," Flow answered:  Active on meta, asking for opinions about how the site's policy/rules should develop. Just query meta for my questions. Although the majority of my meta posts is about tag cleanup work, there are a few others too.  Liam W answered:  Edit and flag history - also that fact that I am currently top of the rep leaderboard for month and week, and second for quarter.  Suraj Bajaj answered:  One of the most active users on the site, one of the top editors (in recent times, as I am a comparatively new user). Top new user...  Suraj Bajaj continued:  Add to that: Being an Android developer and a computer engineer, I am technically sound. :)"
841,"I think you're seeing one of two behaviours that changed recently with @replies. Essentially the @reply isn't auto-completed (and is often removed when you post) if there is only one possible, unmistakable person who's the target of your post and so your @name bit would be redundant. So if you're making a comment on a question that has no answers, and it's the very first comment, then you are obviously making a comment to the questioner, so adding @name is redundant. The other thing that's changed is that when SE thinks that two people are having a conversation (when there's only two of you commenting and you're going back and forth between you) then the @name is removed too, as it's obvious who you're talking to. In these cases even though there's no @name in your comment, because it's obvious who you're talking to the person that you're talking to will still get notified that you're talking to them (for instance question askers are always notified when someone comments on their question with @naming anyone else)."
408,"Love it, love the badge icons and the Andy's holding the banner up at the top, and the overall fairly clean look, with that bit of fun. Not totally convinced about the honeycomb background, but also not sure what it could be replaced with. One suggestion might to do with just making the bar at the top subtly ape the Android notification bar, by removing the background from the top bar, leaving it as a solid colour (or a slight gradient) and left aligning StackExchange logo, while right aligning the search box and icons, username, etc. Anyway love it overall and don't take this as a criticism."
