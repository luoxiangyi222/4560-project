1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
1512,"I think what happened here is that there was already a suggested edit pending on that post when you reviewed it. The timeline looks like (all UTC): During that window between 18:57 and 19:12, you would be unable to suggest an edit on that post since there is already one awaiting review. Thus, when you tried to make some corrections to the post in the review queue, it returned an error. Therefore, I'd say the main problem here is that the text of the error message is very poor. If it had said something more like: You may not currently suggest an edit to this post because one is already pending. ...then it would have more accurately captured the situation."
1326,"The thing with ""too minor"" edits is a good point. AFAIK the background of this restriction is to prevent &lt;2000 rep users from gaming the system by making a lot of small and easy edits that don't completely fix a post. Edits should fix all issues of a post. Not just the minor ones. But if there were only minor ones that needed to be fixed and got fixed with the suggested edit then I tend to approve the edit."
2291,"Looks like someone came to the rescue. As said by @bmdixon in comments,  the suggested edits require two reviewers approval. After going over links of suggested edits, I managed to grab the link of the faulty approved edit and noticed, that at the tine it was not awarded but was waiting for another review.    So if one reviewer approves and the other rejects, a third reviwer is needed to either approve or reject accordingly depending on the post.   Lesson learned: I have to be thorough in reviewing posts and prevent suggested edits that harm post or deviate intended meaning of post from being awarded to users, to ensure that quality is preserved on the site and high levels of reviewing are also maintained. It tends out for now no one is getting banned for approving bad suggested edits this time but it is a wake up call :)"
39,"I totally thought the same thing about the 'android-app' tag being redundant. We should choose which one is the ""authoritative"" tag and edit all the questions to use that one.  I vote we use ""applications"". (Is there a way to blacklist tags?)"
