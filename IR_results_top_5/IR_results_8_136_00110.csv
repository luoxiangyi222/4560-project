2157,"You are right in a lot of ways: And so on. However, the site is not ""going down the tubes"" because this is not new.  We have always dealt with high numbers of these questions, and right now our activity levels are pretty consistent with the past. Making rooting questions off-topic is not really an option.  They can be perfectly good questions and answers (example) and are obviously highly relevant to many Android users.  Many of our most active users are also experts on those types of questions &mdash; it is a core part of the site. I also don't think that separating them out into another area/site will help.  One of the biggest issues we have here is people who completely ignore our existing types of off-topic questions, so such separation would (a) be ignored and (b) not reduce the number of low-quality questions in any way. Instead, I think we should focus on how we can improve them.  We've slowly been forming many ""canonical"" questions for common issues; continuing this is important so that we can quickly mark relevant questions as duplicates and reduce the clutter.  There have also been some suggestions that we ask SE to alter the Ask Question interface to have some sort of warning about our scope and the required level of detail which would be helpful if we could convince them to add it."
1333,"Minor edits should come with added value, like rephrasing the sentences or titles so that they are clearer or easier to understand, adding formatting, or editing the tags where applicable. Minor wrong spellings are where we need to think twice on editing. Sometimes, they are  forgivable, sometimes not. But removing ""thanks"" and ""regards"" alone is TOO minor. As for gaming the system, I agree with the others. These points are too small to be an issue. If this was the motivation alone, then it's not worth the effort. Better things can be done with people's time. So, we should appreciate these types of users who are active in keeping the community clean. [You would want this kind off community in Foursquare] Although we have enough moderators and high-rep members who can do these tasks better, these types of users are better off working on more important moderating tasks. At the end, though, we should strive to make things easier to read / understand."
1597,"Scripts can have accounts too. It would be easy for a spammer or other malicious user to sign in and then give control to his script. Having the possibility of a CAPTCHA for signed-in users prevents this attack. The system has a few ways to guess whether particular activity is from a genuine user. Full details aren't available to us end-users, because that would make the system too easy for attackers to defeat. One common way to make the check go wrong is to leave a page open for a long time before submitting the form; for example, you start to answer a question, then get interrupted, go to lunch, come back an hour later, finish answering the question, and then get the CAPTCHA when you try to post your answer. This is because of a token in the page that expires after some time."
83,"My first thought with all of these is to err on the side of being a little verbose.  I like the format [manufacturer]-[model-name]: htc-droid-incredible, motorola-droid, motorola-milestone, etc.  That way phones with really short names don't get an ambiguous/confusing tag like x. It does become a little unclear whether ""droid"" is officially part of the name for some models, though (for instance, is it the Incredible, or the Droid Incredible?)"
579,"I think part of it is the type of user we attract, for whatever reason.  Most people seem to come looking for a quick fix to a problem and then leave.  Like I've said before, I've seen the same problem on XDA.  Lots of users who take a little and give nothing. I do wonder if that's just how users break down across the Android platform itself -- hardcore early adopters, and then a bunch of people for whom it's just a phone.  Not a ton of power users who aren't experts.  If that's the case, it will take extra effort to bring in a disproportionate number of those users until the platform matures and we get those users naturally. I've also seen several users get excited for a week or so, answering a bunch of questions ... and then leaving, before really reaching the middle-class you speak of.  I'm pretty confused as to why that happens."
