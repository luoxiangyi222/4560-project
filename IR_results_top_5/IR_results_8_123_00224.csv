1947,"That one seems a bit borderline to me. The reason used, ""Questions which are Android-independent...are off-topic..."" is technically correct. I'd expect that Instagram in iOS would act the same way.  But it's also not like you can go to the website and create an account; you can only create an account by installing the app. So I think the question is fine here, even if the answer is probably ""you can't""."
917,"The best you can really do currently is to create a new room and then invite the user to that room. You can also leave a link to the room as a comment on their post if you want. The automated chat link will also create a public room, so from that regard it's essentially the same (and you can give it whatever title you want). One downside is that the auto-inserted link will import the comments from the post into the chat room when it's created. Creating your own room beforehand will not do this, but if you are pre-emptively setting up a chat with someone then there is likely not going to be a long comment thread to import anyway, I'd imagine. This has also been discussed on Meta Stack Overflow."
886,"Nope.  Once you create a bounty, you lose that rep forever.  I think you used to be able to award it to yourself but it ""didn't count"", and now it's just the more sensible solution of not letting you award it to yourself at all. If someone else is able to help or independently discovers the same fix as you, you may want to consider giving them the bounty.  Otherwise just let it expire &mdash; if it does without you awarding it, half the rep will go to the highest-scoring answer if it's at +2 or more, if there is such an answer.  (If not, no one gets any.)"
867,"I'd be careful about merging the 'contacts' and 'people'. Isn't the app in HTC Sense called ""People""?  Also, 2.x and 3.x versions of Android are going to be around (and generating questions) for quite some time yet. I think Matthew Read's suggestion of creating ""contacts-app"" and ""people-app"" is a good one, although I don't think I'm in favor of making one a synonym of the other. They will at least offer a way to distinguish from questions about contacts in general."
2031,"Yes, please edit them! Better grammar makes a post more readable - everybody benefits. A few caveats though. Don't go ""fixing"" American English into British English or vice versa.
And while editing, try to fix as much as you reasonably can - the right capitalization, markdown, and removal of noise.   On Meta Stack Overflow, I created a proposal for a FAQ with help for editors. While that post is aimed specifically at Stack Overflow, I believe that most of it will be helpful on other sites as well. "
