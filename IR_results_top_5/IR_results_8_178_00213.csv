1382,"This is actually a result of a different scenario, but from the front page it's effectively indistinguishable from a normal Community♦ bump. What actually happened here was: In this situation, Community♦ (evidently) becomes the ""owner"" of the last modification to the post since it would otherwise end up being attributed to a non-existent account. In fact, clicking on the timestamp for the last activity on the front page will link you directly to the deleted answer."
1469,"No, those questions aren't on-topic.  The reason is fairly straightforward &mdash; this site is for end-users.  Curiosity is a valid reason for asking a question, but at the end of the day we expect questions and answers to be applicable in some way to a problem faced by an end user. The closest we get to your last question, for example, would be when an advanced user wants to have an extra script or app run on startup.  This would be a valid question for us, and the answer might involved a partial description of the boot process, but laying out the whole process in detail is going to be a lot of extraneous information that our audience simply cannot make use of. Your questions might be on-topic on Stack Overflow but again, it would be best if you could connect them to a problem.  If you were creating your own ROM and modifying boot if not the source code then there would certainly be many reasons to ask those sorts of questions. I think your GPS question is not the most solidly in-scope, but acceptable.  As an end user, you made an observation about something your phone was doing, which resulted in the question."
1210,"When you see a post here on meta titled ""2012 Community Moderator Election Results"" you'll be able to read it and know what the results were. That'll usually happen somewhere between 10 minutes and 24 hours after the election ends.  Of course, someone will probably post the results in chat between 10 and 24 seconds after the election ends. But if that's still not quick enough for you, you can download the OpenSTV software and election data and run it yourself (both will be linked to on the election page immediately after the election ends). How long that takes is up to you. "
1729,"Why wouldn't we? We already accept questions about samsung-galaxy-gear, which is the same class of thing. In general, we have a lot of questions about using Android with certain peripherals, such as Bluetooth keyboards. Since Android Wear is essentially a Bluetooth peripheral that's only for Android devices, it seems even more on-topic."
944,"It's done for Search Engine Optimization, because question titles often don't explicitly mention the common names for their topics. Sounds like you'd be interested in this question on the main Meta site: Should we stop adding the most popular tag to the HTML title on every SE site? One instance where tags aren't added to the title, is if the tag is already included in the question title, eg Any Android phones that don&#39;t support Bluetooth? (random example from the current front page) where the title already includes the word ""bluetooth"" so there's no need to add the tag. This could be what you're seeing in the instances when the tag isn't added to the page's title, and it's just coincidence that most of those happen to only have one tag. Here's an example with more than one tag Connecting Android to Ford Sync via Bluetooth?  where the tag isn't added, as it's mentioned in the question title."
