1973,"After discussing with two to three people and posting this type of question, I found that  No one has any objection on these type of question.  Since it is not possible for all to know about the file standard of android these type of questions will be helpful for people like me. I wanted to know where the saved wifi-passwords are stored and I got an answer from this SE site and therefore I wanted to know about the other files stores in same directory as that of the file which contained the saved wifi passwords.  So this type of questions can be helpful this way. Best Regards, Jasser"
1157,"I have nominated myself, so I think I should provide an answer. I believe that a Diamond Moderator should be active, as well as there. They would need to respond quickly to flags - so they can be dealt with. They would also need to have a good rep - so that people can see that they are trustworthy, as well as having been a member for a good while. I believe that a diamond moderator should always shed some light on their decisions - I know this is hardly possible, but I believe that they should comment, and help new members follow the site rules, and stay on topic. I know this has been quick - but this is what I believe."
362,"For normal users, no.  You cannot directly contact the user unless they provide the information freely on their profile. If there is an issue with another user, feel free to let any of us moderators know."
1202," Liam W answered:  Very good question. I would suggest to them that they continue their answering, but ensure they think about their comments before they post them. I would recommend that as a valued contributor (to answers), they should know the rules. I would ask them to follow them, and then I may have to resort to drastic measures (times suspensions etc).  Flow answered:  Depends on the type of comments he leaves. I never encountered that case on AN.SX. But if I agree with the comments, which is likely if it's a big amount of flags, I would contact him and ask him to stop that behaviour. I like the friendly and polite tone on SX and would like to keep it that way.  Suraj Bajaj answered:  Well, wherever I find any such comment I will act on it. Ask them to be careful and be friendly with users. Everyone's opinion matters but it has to be put in the right way. It hardly matters how much rep you have if you don't know how to behave."
896,"Well, you know, there are such things as on-topic questions that no one can answer. Or, more accurately, the person who can answer just hasn't visited the site. A well-written question with the right keywords will certainly draw websearch traffic, so it's only a matter of time until we get an answer (we hope). On the other hand, dozens of ""how do I install OS (x) on device (y)"" won't be helpful. A canonical question to trap them all would be good."
