2036,"I wouldn't say ""nothing relevant in common"" as Matthew put it (especially with MTK, which has its specifics). But what I agree with: This site is for end-users, and the majority of end-users probably has no clue whether their device features a mt6582 or rk3066 chip – and if they do, they can specify such in the question's text. A tag is not very useful if ignored by the majority even if it would fit – so I agree with Matthew we don't want/need those on an end-user site (it would look different if we were a techie-centric site, sure)."

To put it simply,  questions should be about Android software-specific concerns, or concerns uniquely related to devices that are running Android.  We do occasionally have general hardware questions, but those are the exception rather than the rule -- coming, as you say, from being broadly useful.  They must also be based in expertise that you could expect some Android power users to acquire -- not electrical engineers and so on -- as this site is by and for Android Enthusiasts."
