2232,"I don't know if there is general SE guidance on this, but I would say yes &mdash; clear cut cases seem like a good place for flags.  This site is not at the point where moderators need to heavily triage flags, as yet.  That said, I also go fully through most queues regularly, so a flag is not strictly necessary."
1488,"From what I've seen of questions asked by developers having issue with the Play Store, most of the questions would be closed in any event, simply because (I'll see if I can dig up some examples, but it'll take time.) Further, would any of these questions have people who could answer them? We only have a few developers here; I expect most questions will remain neglected and unanswered.

And what about the slippery-slope issue of, ""Well, you let me ask about Play Store Analytics for my app. Why won't you let me ask coding questions? All the developers are here anyway..."" I think, were we to change our policy, we'd end up with something like what we have with rooting/modding questions. Yes, we have a bunch, and some have good answers, but the really good information is elsewhere, and we're mostly just a gateway to that information. Only worse."

118,"We should email a some of the big Android Blogs an let them know about Android.SE, invite them to join and share their expertise and encourage them to share it as a resource to their readers.  I was going to just do it but maybe we should discuss a game plan. These are the android sites I frequent:"
