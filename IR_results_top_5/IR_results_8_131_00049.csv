313,"I can type into the search box, but I can't seem to get it to submit. When I click the Enter or OK buttons it just seems to change focus to another field. Similarly, I can't figure out how to close the messaging bar at the top of the screen. I can't scroll far enough to the right to close it. Not sure if it matters, but this is with a Motorola Flipside running 2.1."
1192," Liam W answered:  Comments - to notify that user to try and improve. If I understand what they are on about, the edit button. If after a while, nothing has changed, the close or delete button.  Flow answered:  Edit, downvote or flag. More or less in that order  Suraj Bajaj answered:  Depends. If poorly written, edit button would be my first choice. If argumentative, I would prefer leaving a comment. Down vote would always be my last choice. I would rather try to improve (and ask the author to improve), than just down voting. However, last choice is still a choice! :)"
341,"I much prefer a sans font, so I think that's a good choice. As for badges/tags, it'd by nice if they were similar to the standard buttons. A smaller version of  with text might serve for badges. Change the color in the center for bronze/silver/gold. The buttons here  are definitely viable for both. They gray/silver could be for normal tags, the yellow for featured tags. How about this?  It's actually an arm from the Android mascot. Perhaps not as in-your-face green, but the radius of the curve evokes Android."
2187,"A duplicate answer is an answer that does not add any information not alerady in an older answer. Note that the above text is only an example, but you need to provide the link to the original answer, if you want quicker mod action and/or don't want mods to search for a possibly long time to find the original answer because they have to do other things too and you are uselessly delaying them with that. At the bottom of every answer, just above the comment section, there are at least these 3 buttons: ""share"", ""edit"" and ""flag"" (if this isn't there you couldn't flag in the first place.) Then, go to the duplicate answer and do step 5 (or 5.2, if you managed to keep the flag window open all that time). A duplicate answer is a duplicate, no matter when it is posted. It just needs to be posted at least 1 second later than the original one in order to be recognizable as a duplicate."
485,"You make a good point. I have updated the button styling a bit, both on the main site and on Meta. For the main site, I made the button text green, and for Meta they're much darker now.  The changes will be in the next deployment."
