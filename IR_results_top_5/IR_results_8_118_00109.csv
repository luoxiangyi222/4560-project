1973,"After discussing with two to three people and posting this type of question, I found that  No one has any objection on these type of question.  Since it is not possible for all to know about the file standard of android these type of questions will be helpful for people like me. I wanted to know where the saved wifi-passwords are stored and I got an answer from this SE site and therefore I wanted to know about the other files stores in same directory as that of the file which contained the saved wifi passwords.  So this type of questions can be helpful this way. Best Regards, Jasser"
1100,"There's no difference between RAM and memory (in or out the questions) RAM is sometimes called ""memory"" for short which further complicates
  the issue. RAM is a computer chip that assists in speed of the
  computer that is measured in Megabytes (MB) or Gigabyte (GB) depending
  on the size of the chip. When a user chooses to open a file, the
  computer must put that information somewhere to be able to access it.
  It writes the file temporarily to the RAM for easy access. RAM also
  temporarily saves files that are currently being worked on. So I agree with you that they should be merged."
