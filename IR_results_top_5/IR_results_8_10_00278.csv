557,"We shouldcan only create tags when there are posts to put them against. For one thing, no one may actually ask a question about that device. For another, the Stack Exchange software removes tags that don't have any questions associated with them after some number of days. (Four, I think.) So even if we didcould set up tags ahead of time it's likely they'd get deleted before someone used them."
2228,"It's worth considering the type of answer that one will expect to receive. On a development forum like SO, one will likely receive a very technical response.
On a softer (is that the right word to use) forum one will likely receive a less hard-core techie response. Thus, there is merit in having this cross over and even an argument for identical questions on both forums as they'll be asking them in different contexts."

238,"Sounds like something that would be quite useful. If it were one App per Answer, then each app could be individually voted up/down as well as comments left against it...so each answer in itself is useful..."
1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
