2379,"The post that you wanted to edit looked like this: This is what I got so far, it might not be the most efficient way to do it.  pm list packages >/storage/emulated/0/Apps.txt
  diff --unchanged-line-format= --old-line-format= --new-line-format='%L' /storage/emulated/0/BaselineApps.txt /storage/emulated/0/Apps.txt | sed 's/^[^:]*://' >/storage/emulated/0/NewApps.txt I suggest, instead of using whitespaces in every line, use &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;/pre&gt; at the beginning of first line and end of last line. E.g.  &lt;pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt; If you're editing the text which falls between a list, simply add one whitespace before &lt;pre&gt; to align the whole preformatted text with the list. E.g. This is what I got so far, it might not be the most efficient way to do it. "
2187,"A duplicate answer is an answer that does not add any information not alerady in an older answer. Note that the above text is only an example, but you need to provide the link to the original answer, if you want quicker mod action and/or don't want mods to search for a possibly long time to find the original answer because they have to do other things too and you are uselessly delaying them with that. At the bottom of every answer, just above the comment section, there are at least these 3 buttons: ""share"", ""edit"" and ""flag"" (if this isn't there you couldn't flag in the first place.) Then, go to the duplicate answer and do step 5 (or 5.2, if you managed to keep the flag window open all that time). A duplicate answer is a duplicate, no matter when it is posted. It just needs to be posted at least 1 second later than the original one in order to be recognizable as a duplicate."
2373,"The founder of Stack Exchange thinks affiliate links should be treated as spam. Unfortunately, Stack Exchange has not clarified their policy further. To me, they should be immediately removed and the user warned. Things could very easily escalate to edit wars (I want to use my affiliate code, not theirs) and spammy behavior (I'm going to add my affiliate code to this answer that I had nothing to do with...it won't change the text...nobody will care). It's a bit of dirty pool, that. By the way, any links to Amazon.com are re-written to include Stack Exchange's affiliate code. That said, of course, I think it's not unreasonable to have a couple of affiliate links in your profile, but only there."
2129,"If it's clear from context that the user suggesting the edit is the same person as the user who posted the post, then yes, please do approve the edit. Typical clues include: While it's theoretically possible that someone would suggest such an edit with incorrect information because they have the same problem or just to troll, it's unlikely. “I have the same problem” cases are clear from wording. Troll cases can happen, but on factual matters, there's nothing to troll. If an edit suggests text that's an opinion piece, then you should reject it. Accepting the edit obviously helps the original user. It also helps the site as a whole it means that the post will get into an acceptable state sooner, so there are fewer moderation actions to take, there are fewer bad posts around, and helping the user drives engagement up. If the suggested edit is from a second account, please leave a comment pointing to the help center, something like You seem to have accidentally created a second account. Please see [the help center]( for how to merge them. Once you merge your accounts, you will be able to edit your posts directly. This is the policy I follow (whether I'm a moderator or not, I don't see why it would make a difference), and until I saw your question in the moderator election it wouldn't have occurred to me that a site would have a policy against it. Having now seen this meta thread, it still isn't clear to me: I'm not a regular here and I don't have enough reputation to review suggested edits, so don't worry, I won't approve edits by a second account of the same user on this site. Nonetheless I'd like to understand why you find my behavior (on other sites) objectionable."
1118,"Just because a question is Closed doesn't mean that it is locked away forever. Being Closed gives the original author (and others) an opportunity to improve the question and, hopefully, get it re-opened. If you believe that the questions are not essentially the same, then please edit your question to make that distinction. It would be a good idea to link to the other question and explain why yours isn't a duplicate. If the community agrees, those with enough Reputation points can vote to re-open. If that process seems slow, you can Flag the question for a Moderator and explain that you've edited the question to make it clear it's not a duplicate. Or, you could raise the issue here (as you've done) but without making the edits to distinguish the questions it might not go very far."
