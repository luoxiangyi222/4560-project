822,"I normally save the &lt; kbd > tags for actual hardware buttons (or at least buttons that are normally hardware even if they're sometimes soft) like Power, Menu, Home, Back, etc. For menu options and clicking on items on the screen I'd normally either bold them (or for long options like descriptions on tick boxes ""enclose them in quotes"". So for your example I'd say Settings -> About phone -> Android version Or Settings -> Display -> tick ""Auto-rotate screen"" Or giving a Xoom the ""three-fingered salute"" would be hold down Power + Volume Up at the same time."
1973,"After discussing with two to three people and posting this type of question, I found that  No one has any objection on these type of question.  Since it is not possible for all to know about the file standard of android these type of questions will be helpful for people like me. I wanted to know where the saved wifi-passwords are stored and I got an answer from this SE site and therefore I wanted to know about the other files stores in same directory as that of the file which contained the saved wifi passwords.  So this type of questions can be helpful this way. Best Regards, Jasser"

2308,"I use Arch Linux, and have instaled ttf-google-fonts-git. Roboto has always been a part of the package. But the site still looks awful on my computer. When I was typing this as a comment, I couldn't see what I'm typing well enough. Though I can see this just fine when typing in the Answer section.  If you must use Roboto, please use Roboto-Medium or Roboto-Regular instead of thin or light variants. The site is currently unusable for me. And please set up fallbacks for people who don't have Roboto."
