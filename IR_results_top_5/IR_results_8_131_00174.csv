687,"I think only #2 is acceptable, though it might be closed as a dupe.  #1 and #5 are way too subjective, #3 is an off-topic shopping advice question, and #4 isn't a question :P.  (Note we don't take speculative questions either, which applies to most questions about 4.0 and the Fire right now.) If a contest wants to use questions here I think they still need to be real questions, real problems, asked and answerable from a user's perspective."
403,"In this case I do think the tag should have stayed.  But Al is right that we have way too many questions tagged with the device for no real reason.  If you're not sure if it's relevant, just mention your device in the question and leave off the tags.  See also: Should we discourage phone model tags in non-phone-specific questions?"
1241,"It's a problem all over, not just here. Not five minutes ago I voted to close a programming question on Web Applications. And how about all of the ""how do I fix this non-programming Android issue"" questions that have been closed on Stack Overflow? (And believe me, there have been a lot more of them than development questions here.) There are any number of helpful hints to guide potential Askers to the right place. You probably don't remember because you've been around for a while, but there's a dialog that new users need to click through before posting that says basically: I have read what this site is about, I see it again here right in front of me, and this is the right place, so let me ask my question. There's the FAQ, of course. And the ""Ask Question"" page does give guidance, at least until your reputation meets a certain threshold. The problem, and it's not limited to here, is that people don't read on the Web. The only thing that keeps sites on topic is swift, efficient, ruthless moderation when people post off-topic stuff. (Remember Usenet?) That's because people will post off-topic stuff; it can't be stopped. Don't forget, we also have the development tag, which has been left on here as kind of a ""honeypot"" to make it easier to find off-topic questions. (The assumption being, of course, that anyone doing development would see that tag and use it, in spite of the tag wiki excerpt explicitly saying that such questions are off-topic.) Unfortunately, the applications tag (which is terribly misused and abused and is in dire need of cleanup) is almost always one of the sample tags suggested and, since they're developing an application, must be the tag they want, right? So, yes, it's annoying and I wish these people would get a clue. Don't worry about the Moderators' time, though. We don't need to waste it with simple stuff like this. Just continue to vote to close. Downvote them for wasting your time. (Enough downvotes&mdash;six, I believe&mdash;and the question drops off the front page.) If you're feeling kind, point them to the FAQ. But you should probably resign yourself to the fact that no matter how many clues and help and speed bumps we put in front of new users (and there are quite a few), some people are going to post off-topic stuff. All we can hope to do is educate them, hopefully educate people who see their off-topic question and so won't repeat the mistake, and close them down without mercy."
1517,"Placing a comment on the question that is going to cause a dup cycle is the right thing to do. Hopefully users working on the review queue will notice the comment and choose the right action (e.g. Leave Open). I also just noticed that the system prevents duplicate cycles (not sure if only direct cycles or also deeper ones). If the cycle has already been established, the you should flag for mod attention and/or cast reopen votes."
2609,"If you are having a problem in performing a task with an app, you can seek help on our main site. It is within the scope of our main site. Per What topics can I ask about here? in Help Center: If your question generally covers... then this is the right place to ask. Basically, what problem (with your Android device) are you trying to solve? (Emphasis mine)"
