475,"Sure. There are plenty of great topics for blog posts that can hopefully go far above and beyond being a mere reference answer for common questions If this gets traction, coordinate with rebecca@stackexchange.com and she can get a provisional blog set up."
1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
860,This if fine by me. Martin covers all the points I was going to say. Pass on over the good questions. :)
14,"I'm going to say that this depends on how specific it is.  At the least, it should be community wiki.  If it isn't specific enough, then it should be closed."
820,"5 questions isn't much to go by statistically, besides that 2 of the unanswered ones are from shortly before Christmas and the other from yesterday.  Two of them seem fairly obscure as well, so the whole I wouldn't be surprised.  Feel free to edit the older ones (ideally improving them) to bump them to the top of the Active list. Our unanswered question rate is 15% with SO at 19%. I would have expected it to be higher than SO (we do get a lot of obscure questions), but I would agree it does seem a bit high regardless.  Our answer rate is not as high as it was during Beta, either. While I would say the site is ""active"", it's not perfect.  We discussed some of the site's issues before here.  If you have any ideas on how to address any of this, please share them."
