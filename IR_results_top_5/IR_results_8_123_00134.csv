1512,"I think what happened here is that there was already a suggested edit pending on that post when you reviewed it. The timeline looks like (all UTC): During that window between 18:57 and 19:12, you would be unable to suggest an edit on that post since there is already one awaiting review. Thus, when you tried to make some corrections to the post in the review queue, it returned an error. Therefore, I'd say the main problem here is that the text of the error message is very poor. If it had said something more like: You may not currently suggest an edit to this post because one is already pending. ...then it would have more accurately captured the situation."
848,"There is so much text here, so I will keep it short: I had the same thought. Tag based promotion just doesn't work well on AN.SX. IMHO the best promotion is purely reputation based, with a slight addition. Something like: or just Where winners will be randomly chosen between the eligible users. Maybe this will also attract more users to edit the tag wiki to earn the rep."
1588,"My opinion is that questions which are purely about gameplay (""How do I beat level 5 in Inexplicably Popular Social Game-of-the-Month?"") should go to Arqade. They simply aren't about Android the OS, even if the title is platform exclusive. Configuring hardware or something to work with a game could be OS dependent - something like ""How can I set up a Bluetooth controller for my Android device?"" as an example - and those seem okay, but gameplay questions should be directed to...well, gamers. We may have gamers here, but it's just not our purpose."
155,"Al E.'s great idea just needs a little setting up for those that would miss the reference. Something like: ""Android Questions? These are the Answers you are looking for."" (No comments under 50 rep is a PITA! Sorry for the additional answer)"
1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
