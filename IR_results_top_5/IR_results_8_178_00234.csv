2095,"I agree with Al's point. Of course the natural mechanism of the system takes care of such bad/strange answers. However, in some cases, it can be hard giving a very specific answer, thus resorting to using  ""I think..."" or ""Your best bet probably is..."" or ""I haven't tried this app so I don't know but..."" ""I think"" at this point, ""your best bet probably is"" that not everything that works on my phone will work for someone else's phone. Android is Android, yet there are so many caveats, that make giving certain answers sometimes hard to do in different situations. Until one has had the opportunity to use over the 10,000 different types of devices that exist today, I doubt anyone can give 100% certain answers on everything. For instance, in answering this question, I used the expression, ""could"", pointing out that, I'm not certain. Although TWRP saved my life some time ago on my Z2, does not necessarily mean it will work for this OP. I wasn't certain it will work, not because I don't know what I was saying, but because what works for me is different from what will work for someone else. Of course, outright nonsense answers need to be flagged, yet, the idea of suggestions aren't all bad, as what works for me won't work for my friend next door, always! TL;DR Not knowing an answer to a question is different from not being certain something'll work for the OP. Thus, I don't think the use of ... ""I think..."" or ""Your best bet probably is..."" or ""I haven't tried this app so I don't know but..."" ... is entirely a bad thing."

This does seem a bit confusing, though, since you could seemingly approve your own edit based on the by-the-letter description of the 1500 rep priv. I don't know if it actually works out that way, though..."
1531,"Usually questions that could fill a whole book as answer are closed as ""too broad"" on all sites within the SX network. I can't comment on why this hasn't happened on the Security SX example question you gave. The have the same policy about ""too broad"" as any other site. But as eldarathis pointed out, the two questions are not on the same level regarding broadness. QA sites like Android Enthusiasts work best if you have a specific problem. And no, wanting to know how Android works is not a specific problem."
846,"As a new user i know i don't have something to say.
But personally i had never heard of this site before Android Guys wrote an article about your competition, and it was perfect because i had a question which i have looked for in the past month and haven't found any answers too. And suddenly i had a chance to both get a answer on my question and a chance to win a tablet. It was a win win for me, and since i made my user here, i have tried to help a couple of users, and i am pretty sure i will stick here for a good while, because i like the way the site is build and how it is working. So even though i'm a new user, and don't have anything to say, then you should know that the audio competition worked on me :) [off topic]BTW: how do you run this site, there aren't any commercials on the site. Where do you get the money to run the server and buy the prices in the competitions? [/off topic] "
