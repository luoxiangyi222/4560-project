2001,"Here is the breakdown: You had 1+5+2=8 points until an hour ago.      Then you received a downvote on a post of yours which took two points out of the total, ending up at 6 points.  Now, you pretty much had it all figured out, but you're missing the point stated in help center here: (Emphasis mine) This is simply what happened. You received a single downvote (that -1 between the arrows) on your answer which took away  two points from your account and one point from the user who downvoted it."
1210,"When you see a post here on meta titled ""2012 Community Moderator Election Results"" you'll be able to read it and know what the results were. That'll usually happen somewhere between 10 minutes and 24 hours after the election ends.  Of course, someone will probably post the results in chat between 10 and 24 seconds after the election ends. But if that's still not quick enough for you, you can download the OpenSTV software and election data and run it yourself (both will be linked to on the election page immediately after the election ends). How long that takes is up to you. "
896,"Well, you know, there are such things as on-topic questions that no one can answer. Or, more accurately, the person who can answer just hasn't visited the site. A well-written question with the right keywords will certainly draw websearch traffic, so it's only a matter of time until we get an answer (we hope). On the other hand, dozens of ""how do I install OS (x) on device (y)"" won't be helpful. A canonical question to trap them all would be good."
1337,"Looks good, but I miss the info graphic with the 4 circles Wiki, Blog, Digg and ? where Stackexchange is the point in the middle. It always reminded me that I can use Stackexchange sites to document Q&amp;A that may be relevant to other users as well by simply answering my own question in one step."
1674,"I'm partly opposing Dan's answer for the reasons I gave in my comment to it: I doubt there are many ""new users"" doing any research before they post their question. So keeping questions ""as examples how you should not ask"" is a waste, IMHO. I however see a reason to not delete questions which might act as pointers to others. That's best explained using an example:
One of our most frequently asked questions is the ""I forgot my pattern/password and now I'm locked out"" type, which are usually closed as duplicates to Can not unlock my Android device as have no internet connection?. Formerly, that question was phrased ""Can not unlock my tablet..."". When I find such a (new) question and want to VTC it: how to find this ""master question""? Looking for ""Can not unlock my tablet"" makes it hard to find. It however turns out on top of the search when I type in the exact phrasing.
My point? Given a user really does a search before asking, he's unlikely to know the exact phrasing. But with more and more duplicates kept as pointers, chances to have one of them turning up on top of the search results are increasing. Opening that one then leads to the ""final point of interest"". In short words:"
