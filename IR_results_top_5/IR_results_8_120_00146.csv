1803,"I'm terrible at naming things like this, but a lot of the other chat rooms use amusing names to try to mix things up. One that popped into my head was something like: The Candy Shop A chat room for Android users to discuss devices, apps, the latest Android news and gossip, and how many warranties they've voided. Something that plays with the idea of Android releases being named after deserts and such. The description is intended to be a little more friendly but also informational. We probably do need to be conscious of the fact that the room listings only get you 40-50 characters before they truncate (you can see the full description by viewing the room info, though). Therefore, keeping the word ""users"" (or something like that) near the front of the description might be a good idea. Also, by not calling it ""Android"" we might help prevent people with programming questions from getting sucked in."
460,"Maybe something like ""Only add a device or OS tag if your question is truly about your make and model, not just related!"" would be even clearer."
322,"I agree, this isn't the place for it but it would be nice if there was another venue with the same format as SE.  I absolutely despise traditional forums for all the extraneous bs that you have to wade through to find any useful info.  Something like this would really need a voting platform like SE has to let the cream rise to the top."
238,"Sounds like something that would be quite useful. If it were one App per Answer, then each app could be individually voted up/down as well as comments left against it...so each answer in itself is useful..."
778,"It looked like service was actually mostly used to refer to network issues, i.e., problems with ""phone service"".  I replaced it with connectivity in most places, services where applicable.  I think it's probably best to let service die out rather than merge with something else.  If it comes up again we should probably rename it to phone-service or something clearer."
