917,"The best you can really do currently is to create a new room and then invite the user to that room. You can also leave a link to the room as a comment on their post if you want. The automated chat link will also create a public room, so from that regard it's essentially the same (and you can give it whatever title you want). One downside is that the auto-inserted link will import the comments from the post into the chat room when it's created. Creating your own room beforehand will not do this, but if you are pre-emptively setting up a chat with someone then there is likely not going to be a long comment thread to import anyway, I'd imagine. This has also been discussed on Meta Stack Overflow."
867,"I'd be careful about merging the 'contacts' and 'people'. Isn't the app in HTC Sense called ""People""?  Also, 2.x and 3.x versions of Android are going to be around (and generating questions) for quite some time yet. I think Matthew Read's suggestion of creating ""contacts-app"" and ""people-app"" is a good one, although I don't think I'm in favor of making one a synonym of the other. They will at least offer a way to distinguish from questions about contacts in general."
1311,"What circumstances is a general all-round ""yes you can"" or ""no you can't"" going to be useful? Are you just going to spend days throwing random commands at your tablet in random ways, or is there something specific that you're trying to do? What are you likely to be doing that has a chance of bricking your device? A question like ""Is there a chance rooting my device using the FancyNamed Rooting Method could brick my device?"" is answerable, (and will probably already be answered on the support thread for which ever rooting method you use). Your question as it is at the moment is very broad, has a lot of unknowns, and isn't really answerable with any answer that will stay the test of time."
596,"I would tend to agree. Go ahead and start hitting that ""edit"" link. I have updated the tag-wiki for pc to direct people to more specific tags. It might help."
493,"I think a big issue is going to be finding relevant conferences. Google IO sold out in a ridiculously short time, plus I'm pretty sure they don't put out a call for speakers. AnDevCon was OK, but I was pretty disappointed in it as an advanced Android user/developer. Might need to look to some more general conferences such as MADExpo which I saw advertised on MSDN. After a conference is found, finding a speaker shouldn't be a problem: there are plenty of Android fans and developers with plenty to say."
