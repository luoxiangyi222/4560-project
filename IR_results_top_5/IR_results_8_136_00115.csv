1191," Liam W answered:  TBH I do not think that enough members participate on the meta, from when I have looked. It isn't very active, and only the high rep members seem to use it. Some new members do use it, but not often. I believe that, as this is the case, people should take the meta with a grain of salt - it is OK if a suggestion is up voted by 30 people, but what if other users of the site that don't use meta don't like it?  Liam W continued:  However - they could have had a say, but, by not using the meta, they didn't. So I would probably just use it as it is.  Flow answered:  I am active on meta, so yes, I do fell like a representative percentage of the active meta users. I always considered meta as the place that makes the rules. So the feedback is very welcomed and if it's the opinion of the majority, everyone should follow that.  Suraj Bajaj answered:  I am open to feedback. And believe if opinions on meta make sense to me, it should affect my decisions. After all it's a people's site, you have to consider everyone's opinion and hear everyone's voice."
155,"Al E.'s great idea just needs a little setting up for those that would miss the reference. Something like: ""Android Questions? These are the Answers you are looking for."" (No comments under 50 rep is a PITA! Sorry for the additional answer)"
622,"Frankly, I think questions like this should be closed as ""too localized"", but I'm afraid we're going to keep getting them. They're way too localized. Even a question like ""what's new in Android 4.0?"" would be marginal (I'd point them to Wikipedia, I look up what's new in each Google Chrome release on Wikipedia for example). An 2.3.x release on a specific phone model (I'm assuming vendors tweak each release?) is incredibly localized and trivial."
2020,"When, but you still think a better tag is needed, then, I myself tend to be in situations when I do not understand what tag is best and I do not find it good to create  new tag(s) unless I'm sure there exists no other suitable tag. So I simply post the question on the site's chatroom with a brief note of the requirement and let the others take care of it.   If the user activity is low on chatroom then you can consider posting a comment on the question like: For users: The current tags on the question doesn't properly give the hint about the question, neither the question is actually about them. But I can't think of any better tag as of now, so may be one of you can consider an edit with a better tag. Thanks! That has been my strategy. You can find your own or may be somebody else would propose a better one.  As for the meta tags, I'm not placed at best position to comment, but I respectfully disagree with your view about them. Meta isn't a place to  post anything, but it's all about the working of the main site, be it technical or user-centric issue.  If you look at your question again, you're are asking for best practices on what to be done when tags are not suitable and more....  discussion tag exactly fits the question. See its excerpt. It's meant to seek community consensus on an issue.   If you're not seeking consensus then either you've a problem in using the site which goes into support, or there is an erroneous behavior you noticed which obviously fits bug, or you want a new feature, so feature-request goes here.  Also, if you think that the current mandatory tags doesn't cover everything or most of the issues, then it's better to propose a proper and detailed use-case and then argue with why the current mandatory meta tags doesn't fit the use-case yet the use-case as a question is useful. This would give us a better picture of what's going on in your mind since I (as a normal user), as noted, doesn't find an issue with the mandatory tags. So, how would you convince the users like me? But reserve the use-case for another question.  "

If there's any fanciness like a timer or making sure they scroll the page, they'll just cheat it and still not read it. There are already lots of pointers to the FAQ and asking guidelines when you post here for the first time.  (Log out and take a look!)  We can do our best to make sure that content is available and helpful, but we can't do anything about the users who refuse to make use of it. See also: Add &quot;I have read the FAQ&quot; check box to the Ask Question page among many others."
