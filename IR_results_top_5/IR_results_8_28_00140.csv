2087,"Be specific If you ask a vague question, youâ€™ll get a vague answer. But if you give us details and context, we can provide a useful answer. I find this not precise. What details are we expecting from them? At least we should give them a hint as an example, either on same page or with links pointing to high quality questions or templates demonstrating what kind of minimum or recommended amount of information a question should have. There are users (like me) who doesn't pick up easily or do not understand what to pick up if you don't give them examples or even hints. That guideline lacks that crucial info. Following are the solutions scattered across this site or on other sites that I picked up: Unlike other sites, for first time users, this is what Stack Overflow shows to them (a mandatory read):  I don't think it would help us at all, given that Stack Overflow itself is far from solving the problem of unclear and low-quality question even after having this solution for years. Supplementary readings: Forget about readings, we have this approach discussed here: When asking a question, enforce user to read the FAQ first, and the most upvoted answer (from a moderator) notes: It won't work. Like we all do with EULAs, they'll tick the box without reading and keep going. If there's any fanciness like a timer or making sure they scroll the page, they'll just cheat it and still not read it. (Emphasis mine) It is interesting to note that the author of that answer was in favor of that solution when it was implemented long time ago on Stack Overflow. :D I personally too do not find this approach much useful for the same reason. The recently asked question Adding a template question to the Ask Question box seeks input on that regard. It has not received any counter argument as an answer, but neither a helpful answer that sketches out what needs to be there in a template. I find this approaching appealing simply because I couldn't find a way to confirm that it has no merit or less merit relative to other approaches. At first read, it appears to be useful since it can at least acknowledge  the poster the need to mention Android version, Device name, rooting status, among other things we need to sketch out. Note that it is not fine for us to seek such crucial details since posting a comment for such clarification is quite a waste of our time. Don't you agree? But since the given circumstances doesn't give any excuse to us, we're left with one option: to invest/waste our time on something which should've been there at first place. Like every other approach, there is no guarantee that it would work or significantly bring down the amount of time we end up wasting on such questions, but our aim should always be to do the best we can to solve the problem. We may not be able to eliminate it but we shouldn't just live with it either, unless all feasible solutions are considered. Forget it please! It has not stopped the wrath of NAA we receive, so better not be considered for implementation IMO. Note: You need to do some work now!"
279,"Well, the link is using rel=""nofollow"", so the site's not getting any googlejuice. Just because there's a link to a site does not mean that Stack Exchange or the members of the Android Enthusiasts site endorse it, and I don't think anyone would think that. Also, anyone who doesn't follow safe browsing is not going to be protected by us. Without a link it would be academic to find the site via other means. If the link went somewhere other than what it purported to (goatse anyone?) then it might be a problem. As is I don't think it is a problem. I'm interested in other opinions, however."
699,"In going back through the unanswered questions, the following twelve seemed to be more likely to garner a response or interest from average user types.  "
192,"It's basically asking us to parse the news for the asker. As opposed to any other question that is asking us to parse [google|internet|personal experience] ? But speculative questions have no one right answer until the future is past. In that sense, they may be worse than community wiki."
1773,"Custom flags (those raised using the ""other"" reason) are intended for things that cannot ordinarily be handled by the community. These flags go directly to the moderators, whereas other flags will go into various review queues that can be acted upon by other users of the site. Someone saying ""thanks"" is simply not something that is generally going to require direct moderator intervention. It is not actively harmful to the site, and there are tools already available to you that are appropriate for the situation: Secondly, as Dan alludes to in his answer, if you do use the ""other"" flag reason, you need to be really, excruciatingly specific in your message. Your flag is basically telling us ""Hey, something is wrong, and I, as a regular user, am unable to handle it with the current tools. I need a moderator!"" Entering your flag description as ""saying thanks"" doesn't provide us with enough information to act on. In the context of this flag, you actually raised two separate flags on the same post, one minute apart from each other. The first is the flag you noted above. The second was a flag on one of the comments on the post. Moderators cannot respond to comment flags, so we had to respond to the post flag instead, which appeared to be connected in purpose to your comment flag based on the timestamp and the content of each flag."
