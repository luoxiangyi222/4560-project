2372,"Don't forget doze-mode in your list :) We definitely should fix those wrongly tagged power-options – but for the remaining names also consider synonyms (unless there're good reasons for ""keeping things apart""): So I'd say a tag dedicated to (the different) power-saving-modes (including Stamina etc), as ""generic catch"" for those topics would be a good idea. Though we already have doze-mode: and apple is a fruit, but a fruit not necessarily an apple :) Still, at the moment I wouldn't go as far as to create a separate tag for each manufacturer's ""special mode"": Some manufacturers also offer their own battery saver modes. For example, Samsung offers an “Ultra Power Saving Mode,” HTC offers an “EXTREME Power Saving Mode,” and Sony offers a “STAMINA mode” and “Low battery mode.” (How-To Geek: How to Use and Configure Android’s “Battery Saver” Mode) TL;DR: If there are at least 5 questions you'd apply the power-savings-mode tag to, I'd say just do it "
1013,"It seems to me that the answer you refer to is trying to answer the question behind your question. It is, at least, an attempt to answer some aspect of your question. By and large, Moderators are going to be conservative about deleting answers; they'll only do so if it is an obvious non-answer. Frankly, I think your question is off-topic. Certainly it's not an Android-specific issue. All that considered, it's the community that decides. You've received an answer and you've commented that you don't think it is and your rationale. That's good. The community seems to not agree. Re-flagging in hopes of getting a Moderator to issue a different decision is a little disingenuous. (There's an obvious parallel to a child not getting the answer she wants from one parent and going to ask the other parent the same question.) That you've raised the issue here on Meta is fine, as any discussion that can help improve the site is welcome."
1360,Good catch. recovery is now a synonym of recovery-mode.
860,This if fine by me. Martin covers all the points I was going to say. Pass on over the good questions. :)
1917,"which newest questions are unanswered  which questions are put on hold  questions with a high bounty  There is simply no way to include every possible search combination as a UI filter, it would be insanely cluttered and completely unusable. If you want to search for a narrower subset of questions instead of a broad category, that's exactly what search is for and what it's good at.  A huge list of filters in the UI is just going to slow you down. You should take a look at  and familiarize yourself with the search operators you find most useful!"
