926,"If you go to your reputation page in your profile and scroll all the way to the bottom, there should be a little checkbox labelled ""show removed posts"". Check that and you will see any posts that affected your reputation by virtue of their deletion. In your case, the +1 is likely from an answer that you downvoted which was then subsequently deleted, either by the owner or by a moderator. You get the 1 rep cost of the downvote back when the answer is deleted."
1028,"The interesting thing is how many questions of this kind are asked by first-timers (feels like 95% up). It's rarely one with rep coming up with such a question. Next interesting fact is how often the OP shows up afterwards: I'd say 80% up do never show up again, 10% just on the very first day to prove their point and destroy doubts, if possible. Which makes it quite suspicious. Don't take me wrong: The information is freely available if you know the sources, you don't even have to identify yourself to get it. That's why I'd say ""big fish"" never turns up like that (""big fish"" not only knows where the food is, but also ""how to get the crab out of its shell""). So what's left must be either ""small fish"" (those who just ""found"" a single device -- which is not worth the big research and maybe little to big monetary investment), and people of ""legitimate interest"". Not being interested in the former, this leaves the latter. Who are they? People like t0mm13b, who are simply technically interested, or willing to help ""friends in need"" (i.e. people they know). These usually already have a higher rep -- and I see no reason to hide things from them. But then there's the last remaining group: those without any rep, who just f***ed off their device (in this case -- call me bad -- it's a good point to start learning not to fiddle with things you don't understand -- or to be more careful with your sensitive stuff, sorry), or in fact had ""bad stuff happening"" (the brothers little daughter playing with the... how did she get her hands on it?). So my opinion on this: I go with t0mm13b. If technically possible, real sensitive stuff should require a certain rep (at least 1,000+). Everybody below that level could still get the ""obvious legitimate solutions"", such as to specify their Google credentials on a messed-up pattern lock, or see their local Rabbi1... oops, service technician. If it's really your device, you have the papers to prove -- and the solution to your problem is reached faster when taking those papers and looking up a service point (you can return successfully just within minutes) but to prove the legitimacy to ""us"". If it's really a legitimate thing, (s)he will do so. For a petty thief, even this little effort will be too much -- and if it requires more afford, (s)he probably doesn't find it as worth the next time. 1SYLOR is the term for getting sensitive information on e.g. our judaism stack (See Your Local Orthodox Rabbi. Meaning: This is real sensitive (and maybe personal) stuff which should be explained by an expert face-to-face: He can identify you and tell you what you really should know -- as opposed to what you say you need to know -- guess you get my point."
846,"As a new user i know i don't have something to say.
But personally i had never heard of this site before Android Guys wrote an article about your competition, and it was perfect because i had a question which i have looked for in the past month and haven't found any answers too. And suddenly i had a chance to both get a answer on my question and a chance to win a tablet. It was a win win for me, and since i made my user here, i have tried to help a couple of users, and i am pretty sure i will stick here for a good while, because i like the way the site is build and how it is working. So even though i'm a new user, and don't have anything to say, then you should know that the audio competition worked on me :) [off topic]BTW: how do you run this site, there aren't any commercials on the site. Where do you get the money to run the server and buy the prices in the competitions? [/off topic] "
1973,"After discussing with two to three people and posting this type of question, I found that  No one has any objection on these type of question.  Since it is not possible for all to know about the file standard of android these type of questions will be helpful for people like me. I wanted to know where the saved wifi-passwords are stored and I got an answer from this SE site and therefore I wanted to know about the other files stores in same directory as that of the file which contained the saved wifi passwords.  So this type of questions can be helpful this way. Best Regards, Jasser"
572," :) Unlocking questions are on-topic when they're not carrier-specific like getting them to give you an unlock code -- questions need to be about Android. Unlocking and rooting have been ruled legal when the issue has come up in the States, I believe.  I don't know about other areas but it seems there should be no reason for us to avoid them."
