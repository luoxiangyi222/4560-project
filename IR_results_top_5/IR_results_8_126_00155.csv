1601,"Yeah, we can blacklist specific URLs or domains.  But it's unlikely to help here.  Blacklisted terms are fairly easy to work around; if spam is being posted or edited in manually, then it's not too much more difficult for the spammer to use a URL shortener or alternate domain to circumvent the restriction. For those 4 domains, I've found only 6 posts and 2 suggested edits that match any of them (that includes past revisions of posts and rejected edits). Combined with the similarities you've observed, this suggests spammers are already fairly comfortable using ""throw away"" domains to avoid detection. We've taken steps recently to beef up our spam detection systems; the best thing you can do is to flag posts that've been created by spammers, and mark any spam-creating suggested edits appropriately as well. All of this feeds into a database that can block future attempts without the need for further intervention. "
