It should be taking place on the appropriate meta site.  Such meta discussions can still take place with the question being deleted. You posted a meta question, and looking at that meta question there is certainly no clear community consensus that the question should be reopened/undeleted.  Were there to have been a clear community opinion that the closure wasn't correct, you should have seen the question be undeleted and reopened."
2007,"My question is related to Doze Mode, a feature in the Android 6.0 Preview 3 which will be released at the end of this month. My question has been marked [On Hold] but I think it may be important for some people who need to prepare their software for the new version of Android which break some things may be important (it is for me). Why was my question placed on hold?"

985,"I do agree that a little improvement needs to be performed on some of the lightest grey's used. I mainly use Firefox 13.0.1 under Ubuntu 12.04, and with my recently acquired ASUS VE228 LED Monitor, I have some trouble recognizing some of the lightest grey colors currently being used. Using Firebug, I've analyzed and collected some information regarding tags or classes that apply a light grey as a background color for a visual representation: #F4F4F4 is hard to see .post-tag class currently using #F4F4F4 This class is used on on regular tags. e.g., hard-to-see #F3F3F3 is hard to see code tag currently using #F3F3F3  This tag is used on inline code, when we wrap something around a `. e.g., I'm inline highlighted code pre tag currently using #F3F3F3 This tag is used when we either press ctrl + k or use the toolbar button . e.g., #F6F6F6 is hard to see, with considerations .owner class currently using #F6F6F6 This class is used for the background of a users signature. Note:
Since the rectangle for a user signature has a respectable size, it's easier to notice the color difference between the white background and the signature background. #EEEEEE works very well blockquote tag currently using #EEEEEE This tag is used when we either press ctrl + q or use the toolbar button . e.g., I'm a quote block In order to properly understand if this was an issue of my newly acquired monitor, or a overall situation, I've performed some tests (opening and navigating the  page) using difference OSâ€™s and monitors. Here's the conclusions: Windows XP Professional Version 2002 SP3 | ASUS VE228 LED Monitor Browsers used: Result obtained: equal results on all browsers My conclusion for the tests performed is that under optimal color calibration conditions, the light grey's used are hard to distinguish from the white background. It gets really hard when we're reading a paragraph with some inline code, because at first glance I can't spot it. The code-block fails only if we are reading a single line of code. When two or more lines are used, it is reasonable visible, just like the background color for the user signature. Windows 7 Home Edition SP1 | Toshiba Laptop - Satellite C660 (built-in monitor) Browsers used: Result obtained: equal results on all browsers My Toshiba doesn't have any color calibration applied, since I don't perform any graphical design with it. The sole purpose for this laptop is the test of work being developed, just like a client would see it, so, everything is by default across the system. Here, It appears to work well on all browsers on all colors tested. Naturally that the light grey is more like a blueish color than actually a tone from black-to-white. So I can't really rely on this as to a positive assessment, I'll consider it a false-positive. Every grey color currently used below the tone provided by #EEEEEE can't stand out if used on small areas. Some improvements are noted if used of considerably large areas. The #EEEEEE works well for calibrated an non calibrated working environments. Have the following colors updated to a slightly dark tone: This assessment was performed with a Linux tool called Agave. I've used the tool color piker and picked the colors from examples provided on this answer. Then, I've lowered the tone by one, and the result provided was far more visible then the one picked.  HTML color code is placed on the lower right side of the color rectangle Using Agave color picker on this image, I did get the correct code for each rectangle picked. There seems to be no distinction between the colors in use or proposed colors when placed side by side respectively. All three used colors side by side are visually equal. Same goes for the ones suggested. As a side note: one may consider using just one color to replace the three being used."
