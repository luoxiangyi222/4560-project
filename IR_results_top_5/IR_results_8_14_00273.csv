410,"A very pleasing selection of colours, however looking at the images, isn't there a bit too much wasted screen real estate on either side? Also, I hope this is a fluid layout and renders well on most browsers including those on Android devices. Finally - since we depend on QUESTIONS from users, perhaps the ASK QUESTION could be made more noticeable (either via a change of colouring or font / size)? Great work, overall."
773,"I was a little disappointed when I opened this and discovered that I will not be receiving free ice cream sandwiches all week, but this idea is neat, too. One suggestion: Could we enforce some kind of minimum question score in order to be eligible for any drawings? Entering everybody would allow people to post really bad questions like ""Why is ICS so AWESOME!"" just to get an entry. I'd be inclined to say that only questions with a score greater than zero should be eligible (so at least someone else thought it was a good question). (I also realize this would be a bit different than the Kindle Fire contest, where it appeared that people with zero score posts were entered into the drawing provided that no other answers on the question were upvoted)"
488,"I really like the design - very clean &amp; elegant. It does occasionally feel a little bit washed out / monochrome however. I'm sure there are specific elements that could be a bit darker or more colourful without changing the overall elegant feel. I think the most constructive thing to do would be to try and identify specific elements like this, as GAThrawn did here. A few more little accents and highlights like this and I'm sure it would all click together beautifully!"
736,I like it :-) Maybe you could change  to  under What kind of questions should I not ask here?
1992,"While I can follow Firelord's argumentation, it still seems rather a comment than an answer. As a comment, it would be very acceptable: ""It may be … Could you try …"". Then, with the OP having tried and approved, it would be a good answer: solving the issue as proven. Or it would stay a comment when not proven. My approach thus would have been: Flag NAA, leave a comment, convert to comment on the question. BUT: answerer included ""solve the issue as it did for me"", which in fact is kind of prove (empirical) – so it seems to be a valid answer. I agree however it could use a little re-phrasing to make that clear: In my case, this was an issue with Google Now. I was able to solve it this way: Guess you agree: put that way, you wouldn't complain :) EDIT: Sorry for being a bit unclear. I of course didn't mean to say one should always place a comment first :) So in short:"
