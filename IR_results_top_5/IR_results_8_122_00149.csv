913,"You know, I actually think I tried to suggest this a few weeks back but I didn't meet the criteria for suggesting the synonym at the time (and then forgot about it). In any case, agreed and done."
399,"My part in that conversation started because travis said that his phone had the same problem as the OP's, so at first I was trying to find a common thread between their two devices. If they were both running ROMs running Sense UI that would suggest that perhaps it wasn't necessarily a hardware-specific issue and those of us trying to help should focus more on their particular firmwares and not just the phones themselves.  When travis said he didn't know I wanted to try to be clear when explaining to him what he needed to know in order to give me a useful answer. I hope that clarifies my seemingly off-topic comments.  :)"
2363,"This site isn't a forum. There aren't ""follow-ups"" here: there are questions and answers. If you want to ask a question, use the Ask question button. If you know the answer to a question, write it in Your answer under that question. It doesn't matter how relevant it is: if it's not an answer to the question, it doesn't belong there. People who know the answer to your question won't see it if it's not posted as a question, and they can't help you, because you can't answer an answer. Running the site in this format is what makes it a repository of information that's easy to find and navigate, without the problems of thread hijacking and ""me too"" posts that you get on a forum. It means that people who know about the thing you're asking about will see your question on the front page of the site: you're not relying on them looking on the n-th page of a thread about a related question that they're not going to look at because they already know the answer. The tour is a really brief introduction to all of this. You get a badge for reading it, but more importantly, you also learn how to get your questions answered by experts."
1453,"Admins and 10K+ users can see deleted questions/answers, and I think you can see your own ones too if you know the URL for them. What was the question about and do you know which day you deleted it? We can have a look through the mod tools and see if we can find it."
1893,"As for avatars (profile pictures), make sure to permit Gravatar in Ghostery (under ""Widgets""). Images in posts are usually hosted on Imgur – no idea where that should be blocked. I'm using both mentioned tools myself, that's how I know about Ghostery – but I never had an issue here concerning Adblock. Though that might rather be related to a subscribed filter list. Try disabling Adblock for a moment and reload the page; if that makes images showing up you know at least that. Then consider whitelisting all SE sites in Adblock – or checking the filters, if you prefer."
