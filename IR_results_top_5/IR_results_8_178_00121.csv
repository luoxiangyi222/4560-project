2176,"I agree. As the 1+1 uses oneplus-one, I'd say oneplus-two should be the one to stay. There's no oneplus-1 synonym, so I guess we don't want oneplus-2 stay as such?"
1387,"I say no. ""Unknown sources"" is (should be) about the setting. ""Sideloading"" is (should be) about the act of installing an app outside of the context of the Market/Play Store/etc. They are related, sure, but I don't think they're the same."
1222,"Ok, now I have got over losing (I think), time for this. I just wanted to personally thank everyone that took part and voted, and also every one of the 16 people that chose me as their preferred candidate. If we ever have another election, then maybe I can win this time - maybe more people will vote for me. Congratulations to the two winners, Flow and onik - well done :) If I ever get caught up in my thoughts again, direct me to this post please - and thanks to Izzy for calming me down Yesterday on the chat :) You never know - maybe two moderators will drop out for some reason and I will get instated ;) Just let me say thanks to everyone involved - and congrats to the winners."
328,I asked the other StackExchange moderators and they say that the mod tools appear for 2k rep on beta sites.  Otherwise I'd say the alert is just being wonky of telling you about the tools.
1773,"Custom flags (those raised using the ""other"" reason) are intended for things that cannot ordinarily be handled by the community. These flags go directly to the moderators, whereas other flags will go into various review queues that can be acted upon by other users of the site. Someone saying ""thanks"" is simply not something that is generally going to require direct moderator intervention. It is not actively harmful to the site, and there are tools already available to you that are appropriate for the situation: Secondly, as Dan alludes to in his answer, if you do use the ""other"" flag reason, you need to be really, excruciatingly specific in your message. Your flag is basically telling us ""Hey, something is wrong, and I, as a regular user, am unable to handle it with the current tools. I need a moderator!"" Entering your flag description as ""saying thanks"" doesn't provide us with enough information to act on. In the context of this flag, you actually raised two separate flags on the same post, one minute apart from each other. The first is the flag you noted above. The second was a flag on one of the comments on the post. Moderators cannot respond to comment flags, so we had to respond to the post flag instead, which appeared to be connected in purpose to your comment flag based on the timestamp and the content of each flag."
