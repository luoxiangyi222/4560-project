1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
1631,"If it is just a copy-paste from a single comment, I usually do that and make it a Community Wiki. I fully agree with you, we should not adorn ourselves with borrowed plumes :) I however skip the Community Wiki part if I combine an answer from multiple comments while adding some more details (or point out connections/background). In that context, I don't feel it unethical to win reputation, as I put some real effort in my post."
2405,"I think it's important to look past the words the questioner happened to use, to see what the intent of the questioner is, and I wish close-voters would put a little more thought into that. This isn't 3-2-1, and you shouldn't lose everything just because you happened to use the magic word ""app"" in your question. Recommendation questions are opinion-based. They ask for lists of answers, and they tend to get spam answers as a result. The answers are less useful than Google Play search results, because they go out of date quickly. This is why we don't like them on the site. Which is the best music player? or Is there a good third-party SMS app? These are simplified examples of bad questions. What kind of answer will they get? A million answers saying ""I like such-and-such app, it's the best"" with no justification. An answer with a one-off copy-paste of Izzy's app lists, which will slowly go out of date or need editors to keep updating it over time. I have a bunch of CSV files in Google Drive and I need to download them when they change and add the results up. Is there an app for that? or I play games on my tablet with my kid ""helping"" sitting on my knee. He often grabs the rim of the tablet and pokes the volume button and makes it really loud. I need the volume buttons turned off when I'm playing a game. Is there an app for that? This doesn't seem like a ""recommendation"" question to me. What kind of answer will it get? There still might be more than one. It might say, ""Use such-and-such app, it can do this out of the box,"" but more likely, it'll say ""You have to install Pushbullet or IFTTT to find out when the file changes, then use Tasker to schedule downloading them and open Excel for Android to load the CSV files,"" or ""You need a custom ROM for this. Lineage can do it."" The difference is, you can replace ""Is there an app?"" with ""How do I solve my problem?"" without really changing the meaning of the question. In the recommendation questions, you can't do that. I think that's the crucial difference. If I find a question like this second pair of examples in the close vote queue, I'll typically make that edit so that people don't close the question, but I don't think the edit should be needed. Just because someone thought an app is the most likely solution to their problem, that doesn't turn a good problem-solving question into a recommendation question. I think we should all apply that test in our head: can I replace ""is there an app?"" with ""is there a solution?"" without changing the meaning of the question."
