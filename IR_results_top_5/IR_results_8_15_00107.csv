2089,"I too think it is pretty much off-topic. Example 1: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one should I buy? We simply can't know the expectations and parameters of choice of any person. Example 2: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one is
better? Since utility of a good is not quantifiable, the answers are going to be pretty much subjective and opinion-based. Example 3: I want a phone with following specs: blablabla Can you guys suggest any? There are websites that find phones with the desired specs already."
166,"It's pretty safe to say that shopping recommendations are off topic on virtually any Stack Exchange site (unless someone builds an explicit ""shopping recommendation"" site, of course).  It's even listed as off-topic in your original charter&hellip; twice: Where is the best/cheapest place to buy a HTC Desire?

47,"The pertinent question, of course, is how much the additional criteria narrow it down. For example, if you ask for a browser app with bookmarks, that's pretty lame - they all have that.  Your example of a books app with barcode scanning and GoodReads integration is much better because it narrows it down to probably less than 5 or so apps. Of course, the voting is still pretty meaningless, but at least it's not an open invitation for everybody to post their favourite app. So for the most part, yes, I would say that the question format is valid, although individual questions would still have to be evaluated individually with respect to how meaningful the constraints are."
629,"It's always a good idea to put an extract or a summary with a link. If the link is dead someday, that can help track down the new location (if it exists) and/or give a guide to solving the problem in the absence of the original site. Link-only answers should always be discouraged, as that would just make this an extension of google (or an old-fashioned curated yahoo)."
622,"Frankly, I think questions like this should be closed as ""too localized"", but I'm afraid we're going to keep getting them. They're way too localized. Even a question like ""what's new in Android 4.0?"" would be marginal (I'd point them to Wikipedia, I look up what's new in each Google Chrome release on Wikipedia for example). An 2.3.x release on a specific phone model (I'm assuming vendors tweak each release?) is incredibly localized and trivial."
