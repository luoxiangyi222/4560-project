579,"I think part of it is the type of user we attract, for whatever reason.  Most people seem to come looking for a quick fix to a problem and then leave.  Like I've said before, I've seen the same problem on XDA.  Lots of users who take a little and give nothing. I do wonder if that's just how users break down across the Android platform itself -- hardcore early adopters, and then a bunch of people for whom it's just a phone.  Not a ton of power users who aren't experts.  If that's the case, it will take extra effort to bring in a disproportionate number of those users until the platform matures and we get those users naturally. I've also seen several users get excited for a week or so, answering a bunch of questions ... and then leaving, before really reaching the middle-class you speak of.  I'm pretty confused as to why that happens."
1157,"I have nominated myself, so I think I should provide an answer. I believe that a Diamond Moderator should be active, as well as there. They would need to respond quickly to flags - so they can be dealt with. They would also need to have a good rep - so that people can see that they are trustworthy, as well as having been a member for a good while. I believe that a diamond moderator should always shed some light on their decisions - I know this is hardly possible, but I believe that they should comment, and help new members follow the site rules, and stay on topic. I know this has been quick - but this is what I believe."
1419,"As there (currently) is no way to ""categorize"" related tags, it might also be a good idea to sum them up in the ""most generic"" tag of the group to make them easier to find. For example, the security is such a ""quite generic"" tag. So its tag-wiki could contain a list of related tags such as '2-step-verification', 'malware', 'antivirus', 'lost-phone', and the like. Having such a list in a ""single place"" (i.e. the ""declared master-tag"") makes them easier to manage as well: other places (e.g. other tag-wikis) could simply refer to that place (""for other related tags, also see..."") -- and the ""related-list"" would only need to be maintained once."
2598,"First of all, welcome to Android Enthusiasts Stack Exchange, a Q&amp;A site focusing on Android end-users solving their issues. Consider taking a quick tour to get a short introduction on how Stack Exchange works in general. Regarding the reason why the question was closed, ignoring the fluff/rambling, there are at least more than 1 tangential questions: While all of them are related to audio volume, solutions to one issue are possibly unrelated to other issues, making it unfocused (previously known as ""too broad - multiple questions on a single post""). The problem with multiple questions on a single post is, answerers are expected to solve all the issues, preventing them from posting an answer if they only know the solution to an issue or two. Evaluating the answers also becomes difficult since an answer may contain a good solution to one issue but poor solution to another, while another answer provides vice-verse, making it a confusing situation for the voters and future readers. Take note that developer-related questions (like asking for the API and how to build a ROM) are generally discouraged since the user-base of this community is Android end/power-users, but not necessarily developers. The fix is to separate these issues into multiple posts, one focusing on a specific topic. Before posting a new question, please also search for existing questions to prevent duplicates."
