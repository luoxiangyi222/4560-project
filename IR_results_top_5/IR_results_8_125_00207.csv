1180,"As The Andro Nerd said, you have the option of just making your 1st Choice selection and the others will be ignored. Just note that in this voting system, if your candidate ""doesn't make the cut"", you will have no voice at all in what other candidates will be chosen. If you have already cast your votes, you can change them back to ""no vote"" by changing your choice then changing it back. Since you can have only one of each choice, if you select someone with the same choice it will remove it from the other person. Here, this should illustrate: Suppose you start out like this: You really just want to vote for Person A. You can do that with a couple of steps. Just change your vote(s)."
2038,"If the changes to be made are so minor that you can't find anything else to change, then just move on. In my experience, there is rarely a post that needs edits where there is not more than six characters to fix. Even so, there are plenty of other posts that are in serious need of editing. Once you get to 2000 reputation you won't have to worry about it."
634,"The answer is simple: Because it is more convenient to just post a link instead of a comprehensive answer. But, as this questions demonstrates, users like it when it's more convenient for them. GAThrawn and I have posted the same answer (I think we even googled the same page :-)), but mine was more rewarded by the community. I think mostly because my answer already contained everything that's needed, whereas the answer from GAThrawn contains a short answer and a link.
So it was beneficial for me to include as many information as possible in my answer, including the source.  I think that this be pointed out for new users/when posting answers: A link as a first answer is a good start, but if the answer contains nearly everything that's needed, the chanches for upvoting are way higher (reputation $$$)."
681,"Good question. While the changes are not neglectable, most changes are in fact development related. But this was also the situation with older version updates, where AN.SX still keeps distinguishable tags. I am not completely decided, but I tend to vote for keeping the honeycomb tags separated."
666,"Not sure about smartphones. But there is also tablet, so maybe it makes sense to keep the smartphone tag also. I am in favor of blacklisting mobile-phones and cellphones. Matthew is right: If the phone functionality in question is calling, calls is the tag to go. And for everything else, mobile-phones and cellphones is to broad and inaccurate."
