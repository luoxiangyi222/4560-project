1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
463,"I don't think so.  I've used all my votes a few times and never got the badge again.  This makes sense to me though.  If I were creating the badge system, this badge would serve to encourage people to get into the habit of voting.  The Nice Answer badge, however, would serve to recognize people for their good answers, and it makes sense to recognize all of them instead of only the first one."
867,"I'd be careful about merging the 'contacts' and 'people'. Isn't the app in HTC Sense called ""People""?  Also, 2.x and 3.x versions of Android are going to be around (and generating questions) for quite some time yet. I think Matthew Read's suggestion of creating ""contacts-app"" and ""people-app"" is a good one, although I don't think I'm in favor of making one a synonym of the other. They will at least offer a way to distinguish from questions about contacts in general."
1991,"It just came to my mind, what would be our reaction if it is written as:  ""Go to Google app which use your location to personalize it. Go to app and disable it. Hope it helps.""  It is still a hypothesis because it isn't proved how Google app is related to the question, but since in my made up answer the user wrote with confidence, we wouldn't be having  much reason to flag it as VLQ, other than content based issue. Now, for the real point. In its current condition, it's not a very low quality answer for two parameters but one, which I explained below.  Reasoning for VLQ isn't very clear but the flag excerpt says: This question has severe formatting or content problems. This question is unlikely to be salvageable through editing, and might need to be removed.  The reason I didn't mark it as a VLQ answer is because we have multitude of such answers on the main site, and while they don't reason well, they many times help the visitors to get rid of the issue, which the latter is most interested in. The suggestion I would like to give is to use a downvote (if only you're convinced that the answer is wrong or not useful), or leave a comment explaining the issue and providing suggestion.  I see that you upvoted my comment, so you indirectly already did your part of commenting on the answer. Note that to flag or not to flag as VLQ  also creates a dilemma of whether to allow such answers on this site or be moderate/strict in controlling them. If you're a moderate/strict in approach then don't think your action as unreasonable even if your flag ends up as Declined. As for me, I use all the approaches all the time! "
