2144,"I agree that power is a bit uninformative. I'm not yet convinced that making it a synonym for power-on is the right thing in the long term. While a lot of existing uses of power are about startup, there are a lot more about the power button. If those questions start being tagged with power-on, then that tag will become as useless as power is now. Maybe we need a new power-button tag."
1275,"One of the points explained in How does accept rate work? appears to apply here: The question in question is not old enough to be counted toward your accept rate yet - it's less than an hour old. In addition, even if the question was 3 days old, that answer is relatively new. Another relevant point from the above linked answer: So this looks like it's status-bydesign."
413,"Consensus seems to be that there's only so much we can and should do for new users. An awful lot of the time they're just ""drive-by"" askers who will get their answer (perhaps) and be gone, never to contribute to the site. There's no point in spending so much time on them. For myself, I just try to remind people who find their own answer to post it as such and ""accept"" it, so that other people with the same issue will see the solution. I think occasionally reminding users that they should accept the answer that worked for them is okay. If you're seen as a person who does it habitually, however, people may start flagging your comments. Here's some relevant links:"
235,"If you have an account with +200 reputation anywhere in the Stack Exchange network, you will start on all new sites with +100 rep for a total of 101. Beyond that, we encourage the truly new users to contribute a bit and give the community the opportunity to get to know them and vote on their posts .. before we give them voting permissions. As for meta, it's tricky. I would like to allow new users to participate here but it's almost impossible to do so without risk, because metas are very low traffic and a malicious new user could cause a lot of damage by posting junk. Thus the 5 rep requirement to keep the bar as low as possible -- at toe level at least. There is also the argument that participating on meta is a (very minor) privilege that you should earn by at least participating on the main site for a little while, so you have a basic level of familiarity with our sites and how they work. We get a significant number of brand new users who come into meta.so (which allows 1 rep participation) and start explaining how we're all doing it wrong, our entire system is broken, the sky is falling, etc etc. All the old timers just roll their eyes.."
1016,"This is a new and interesting feature that allows users to spend less effort while doing their part to this community network. The new feature, as any other feature comes with potential bad habits that one may get caught in without noticing. Some that I've noticed across SE are: Clicker happy Experienced users or new users all get involved in such a way that may forget about the real purpose of the review area. Take you time, analyze what you are reviewing: Is there an actual “accept ALL the suggested edits” problem? The usage for competition One interesting part of the new review is that we are able to view who's the top reviewer, what position are we in, and even compare decisions by looking at the review history.  This serves the purpose of providing users a way to improve themselves and refrain from committing mistakes, by learning with others. It is not the Olympic Games, there's no fat payment for the first place, so, don't go voting just because! Vote and review always with the community shirt on. Exaggerated point of view One may get addicted, and as any addiction, there are side effects. If you're tired of seeing what you consider bad answers or bad questions, take a break from review, use the chat to exchange ideas, post a question at META to clarify you point of view. Remember the famous: Could we please be a bit nicer to new users? Don't spend your precious time reviewing just to feel tired and saturated. I'm answering this as to illustrate some of the frequent problems I see on the several SE sites, being discussed on META, and even some that I've personally experienced and/or have been confronted by. Feel free to improve it."
