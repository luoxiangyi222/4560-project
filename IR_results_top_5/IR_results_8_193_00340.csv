399,"My part in that conversation started because travis said that his phone had the same problem as the OP's, so at first I was trying to find a common thread between their two devices. If they were both running ROMs running Sense UI that would suggest that perhaps it wasn't necessarily a hardware-specific issue and those of us trying to help should focus more on their particular firmwares and not just the phones themselves.  When travis said he didn't know I wanted to try to be clear when explaining to him what he needed to know in order to give me a useful answer. I hope that clarifies my seemingly off-topic comments.  :)"
393,"I think for that particular question it's okay. The issue doesn't appear to be device specific, so the steps JonnyP is suggesting should help both people. If Travis had opened a new question, we almost certainly would have closed it as a duplicate of this question. That's not to say that it's okay to hijack someone else's question, but that in this case I don't think it's out-of-bounds."
1682,"The +100 rep association bonus is not counted in the protection algorithm. The post notice states (emphasis added): To answer it, you must have earned at least 10 reputation on this site. and the ""on this site"" part is actually quite literal, though not entirely clear. Therefore, looking at your rep history, you've got +100 for the association bonus and +5 for an upvote on one of your questions. That nets you 5 rep from your activities on this site, which is still shy of the 10 needed. There is also a more detailed explanation of the ""protected"" status on Meta Stack Exchange, for reference. In this specific case, the view count of the question is pretty low, so I'm going to remove the protection. It looks like it was applied because it picked up a bunch of non-answers within the first 24 hours, but then the views petered off after that."
587,"I wouldn't mind a Bluetooth headset. Gift certificate for the Android Market/Amazon App Store/et cetera? I suggest against a case. There are too many form-factors out there. I've already got one, but one of the plastic Android toys would be cool to give away. There's some new cool ones out: "
2132,"This was discussed in Is it ever acceptable to prod a user into accepting an answer? and in the posts linked there. The comment by Jeff Atwood is worth repeating: I would only remind users who have shown signs they are going to stick around. Reminding a drive-by user isn't useful. A drive-by user might have posted their question on five forums, got an answer at three, of which they read one - and it wasn't yours. Chances are they'll never be seen again, at least not from the same account. So the comments just create noise for others reading the post.  Other things to consider:"
