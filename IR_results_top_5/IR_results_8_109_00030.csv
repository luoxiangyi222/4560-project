949,This is done. I ended up performing the following steps:
1597,"Scripts can have accounts too. It would be easy for a spammer or other malicious user to sign in and then give control to his script. Having the possibility of a CAPTCHA for signed-in users prevents this attack. The system has a few ways to guess whether particular activity is from a genuine user. Full details aren't available to us end-users, because that would make the system too easy for attackers to defeat. One common way to make the check go wrong is to leave a page open for a long time before submitting the form; for example, you start to answer a question, then get interrupted, go to lunch, come back an hour later, finish answering the question, and then get the CAPTCHA when you try to post your answer. This is because of a token in the page that expires after some time."
1936,"The more appropriate close reason for the current and previous revision of the post might be ""primarily opinion based"". You could argue that one could collect statistics about which manufacturers upgrade the most often, and so on, but it's a rather complicated endeavor.  Within specific time periods and device lines you're going to find wildly different information, and none of it is useful going forward because there are simply no set-in-stone policies here.  We want questions to be useful to future readers without their answers needing to be revised all the time. Ultimately it still seems like a shopping advice question, or at least suffers from the same issues as those questions. I can't comment on the views of the other mods, but upon logging in today I found that all of them had viewed your post and declined to take action which is why I dismissed your flag."
2091,"5 minutes from the time of your initial vote. In other words, you can change your vote as many times as you want within that initial 5 minutes. Changing your vote does not reset the timer."
867,"I'd be careful about merging the 'contacts' and 'people'. Isn't the app in HTC Sense called ""People""?  Also, 2.x and 3.x versions of Android are going to be around (and generating questions) for quite some time yet. I think Matthew Read's suggestion of creating ""contacts-app"" and ""people-app"" is a good one, although I don't think I'm in favor of making one a synonym of the other. They will at least offer a way to distinguish from questions about contacts in general."
