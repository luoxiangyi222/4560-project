356,"This is very similar to a shopping recommendation and much of the same advice applies.  Beyond that, consider: you have created an ""infinite list of X"" question. Surely there is (probably) an Android equivalent for every single iPhone app? the equivalents, even if valid now, may change over time; apps change over time. The value of this list will be highly limited as it ages. Perhaps if you had specific things you were looking for Android equivalents to on iPhone -- like the built in default applications. But scoping it to ""any app that can ever be, or will ever be"" just doesn't work."
533, says they're the same. I'll create synonyms. Update: This is now complete.
1836,"Assuming the instructions for the other device don't apply, downvote. The downvote tooltip says: This answer is not useful Giving instructions for another device that won't work for the device asked about seems pretty ""not useful"" to me. If you're feeling kind, also (or instead) leave a comment saying so. ""These instructions are for the HTC Foo. They won't work for the Samsung Baz, which is what was asked about."""
1333,"Minor edits should come with added value, like rephrasing the sentences or titles so that they are clearer or easier to understand, adding formatting, or editing the tags where applicable. Minor wrong spellings are where we need to think twice on editing. Sometimes, they are  forgivable, sometimes not. But removing ""thanks"" and ""regards"" alone is TOO minor. As for gaming the system, I agree with the others. These points are too small to be an issue. If this was the motivation alone, then it's not worth the effort. Better things can be done with people's time. So, we should appreciate these types of users who are active in keeping the community clean. [You would want this kind off community in Foursquare] Although we have enough moderators and high-rep members who can do these tasks better, these types of users are better off working on more important moderating tasks. At the end, though, we should strive to make things easier to read / understand."
2012,"These questions are not considered to be within our scope: Please note the following topics are expressly off-topic here:
   ...   They were determined to be too problematic because they generally lack lasting value, often attract spam, and often end up being more popularity contests than anything else. Such questions are also sometimes viewed as inherently being ""help me Google this"", and therefore don't mesh well with the goal of building a knowledge repository outside of providing a link or pointer to elsewhere. You could consider asking for recommendations in chat, if you'd like."
