823,"I think as long as it's clear you're good to do whatever you want.  Like GAThrawn I would leave the keyboard buttons for actual buttons, though I tend to use bold or nothing for them myself.  I also tend to use inline code for menu items. I suppose in an ideal world we would have a standard, or perhaps site-specific ways to indicate various Android UI elements, but I don't think it's particularly important."
2276,"Yes, it's mainly there so that when someone tries to ask a development question, they can see the tag wiki excerpt: Development questions are off-topic. Do not ask them here. That said, if you browse that tag, you can see that there are some questions there which are about using Android as a development platform, which is OK. If your question is about using Android, it's OK, even if you're a developer or you want to use it for things related to software development. For example, there are some questions in that tag about using Android to write Python code for use on other platforms. They're relevant to our community because the same issues might come up with other text editing tasks. Obviously if the question were along the lines of ""I used my Android phone to write this Python code ... but it doesn't work. What's wrong with my code?"" that question would be off-topic, because then it's not about using Android any more."
794,"I'd say it's fine.  Wanting your services consolidated is a perfectly OK criterion for potential solutions, as is not using a web app. Things to note:"
2379,"The post that you wanted to edit looked like this: This is what I got so far, it might not be the most efficient way to do it.  pm list packages >/storage/emulated/0/Apps.txt
  diff --unchanged-line-format= --old-line-format= --new-line-format='%L' /storage/emulated/0/BaselineApps.txt /storage/emulated/0/Apps.txt | sed 's/^[^:]*://' >/storage/emulated/0/NewApps.txt I suggest, instead of using whitespaces in every line, use &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;/pre&gt; at the beginning of first line and end of last line. E.g.  &lt;pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt; If you're editing the text which falls between a list, simply add one whitespace before &lt;pre&gt; to align the whole preformatted text with the list. E.g. This is what I got so far, it might not be the most efficient way to do it. "
822,"I normally save the &lt; kbd > tags for actual hardware buttons (or at least buttons that are normally hardware even if they're sometimes soft) like Power, Menu, Home, Back, etc. For menu options and clicking on items on the screen I'd normally either bold them (or for long options like descriptions on tick boxes ""enclose them in quotes"". So for your example I'd say Settings -> About phone -> Android version Or Settings -> Display -> tick ""Auto-rotate screen"" Or giving a Xoom the ""three-fingered salute"" would be hold down Power + Volume Up at the same time."
