848,"There is so much text here, so I will keep it short: I had the same thought. Tag based promotion just doesn't work well on AN.SX. IMHO the best promotion is purely reputation based, with a slight addition. Something like: or just Where winners will be randomly chosen between the eligible users. Maybe this will also attract more users to edit the tag wiki to earn the rep."
846,"As a new user i know i don't have something to say.
But personally i had never heard of this site before Android Guys wrote an article about your competition, and it was perfect because i had a question which i have looked for in the past month and haven't found any answers too. And suddenly i had a chance to both get a answer on my question and a chance to win a tablet. It was a win win for me, and since i made my user here, i have tried to help a couple of users, and i am pretty sure i will stick here for a good while, because i like the way the site is build and how it is working. So even though i'm a new user, and don't have anything to say, then you should know that the audio competition worked on me :) [off topic]BTW: how do you run this site, there aren't any commercials on the site. Where do you get the money to run the server and buy the prices in the competitions? [/off topic] "
1906,"Overall I like the new theme. Feels much fresher. A couple of things I'd like to mention: status-completed Adding images to posts doesn't seem to be working for me now. The transparent gray overlay appears on top of the modal. Trying to click the dialog instead causes a click on the transparent layer, which dismisses the dialog. This is Chrome 41, Windows 7. The below images were added by editing a post on a different site and copying the links over here.  status-completed The icon in the SE menu is different from the favicon. Is there a plan to make these the same? I like the favicon much better, personally:  Speaking of icons, the one in the header logo on the main site is very faint. I actually like it better in green, because right now you can barely see it due to the lack of contrast. I understand if this may have been a deliberate choice, but I personally think it looks odd. Excuse my poor Paint.NET skills on this one, but here's a kind of general comparison.

2451,"I was the one who declined the flag, and eldarerathis's explanation is spot-on. I was having a clear-out of old flags - mostly, ones which we've all looked at but nobody was especially keen to delete. Without the context of the other answer, it just looks like a one-line answer that's low-quality but not very low quality. I suspect if this answer had been reviewed in the ""low quality posts"" queue, the outcome would have been the same, because you don't get to see other answers in the queue either. As Izzy says, if the reason for the flag is not clear by looking at the post itself, it's better to use a custom ""in need of moderator attention"" flag. That applies to duplicate answers like this, spam flags where it's not obvious why the post is spam, and some other cases. Another option is to add a comment to the answer before flagging it. Comments are visible in the flag and review queues, so if you explain the issue to the person who posted, we'll see it too. Just remember to be nice in that case, because your comment will be visible to everyone. With an answer like this one, you could comment something like, ""Are you trying to reply to so-and-so's answer by copying the text of it? Answers don't work like that on this site. If an answer works for you, vote it up so that other visitors can see it's good."" Then if you flag, it's obvious to whoever handles the flag (whether a moderator or anyone in the review queue) that you think the answer is a copy, and we can check it out."
2383,"We don't have review audits on this site. While the second one does look like the random garbage of an autogenerated edit for an audit, it's a real edit someone suggested. We do occasionally get rubbish edits like this, and more often spam edits like the first one you linked. Like flagging posts as spam, rejecting edits as ""spam or vandalism"" feeds the suggester's info (IP address etc.) into the anti-spam system, making it harder for them to come back and keep wasting our time with spam edits."
