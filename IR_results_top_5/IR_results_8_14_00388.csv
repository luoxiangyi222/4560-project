1519,"Well, we're all public in some ways. Between all of our linked accounts if someone wants to find a personal email address or web site they're going to find it. This is very poor etiquette by the person who emailed you. They shouldn't have done it. However, there is nothing Stack Exchange can do to prevent it, nor should the person be ""punished"" by Stack Exchange because of something they did off the network. In a way, it's understandable. Very often when you're desperate to find a solution you'll grab at anything that looks like a lifeline. Personally, I suggest to simply ignore them. Perhaps create a filter to automatically delete any messages from them in the future. If you're kind, you might respond with something like I'm sorry, but I can't help you. I am happy to volunteer some of my time helping the people who ask questions on Stack Exchange, but I can't possibly offer personalized help. Good luck to you. If you're feeling snarky, you might further respond with something like However, if you would be willing to pay my hourly rate of $150 per hour, minimum 10 hours, I can probably be convinced to help out. Of course, I would need that money up front and if this can't be done remotely you'll need to pay my airfare as well. I wouldn't recommend that last, though. I'd just simply ignore it and twit 'em."
1329,I'd like to hear other opinions too but my stance is that it's ok. Especially since you are an (active) member of the site and sure going to watch the ankidroid tag.  I'd like to make it clear that it's was 100% correct to ask first. Android Enthusiasts should not become a support/discussion forum for the various Android Apps out there if they Apps have a dedicated forum or help site. The question that remains is: Does AE.SX become a second place for Ankidroid support or are you going to close/archive the Google Group?
2187,"A duplicate answer is an answer that does not add any information not alerady in an older answer. Note that the above text is only an example, but you need to provide the link to the original answer, if you want quicker mod action and/or don't want mods to search for a possibly long time to find the original answer because they have to do other things too and you are uselessly delaying them with that. At the bottom of every answer, just above the comment section, there are at least these 3 buttons: ""share"", ""edit"" and ""flag"" (if this isn't there you couldn't flag in the first place.) Then, go to the duplicate answer and do step 5 (or 5.2, if you managed to keep the flag window open all that time). A duplicate answer is a duplicate, no matter when it is posted. It just needs to be posted at least 1 second later than the original one in order to be recognizable as a duplicate."
2170,"The reason I opted for a single expansive answer is because there are really only two core things involved (most of the time): Get USB Debugging enabled. Get the Factory Reset option enabled. Likewise, these generally involve the similar sub-steps &mdash; trick a browser window into opening, trick Settings into opening, maybe create another user account, flag first-time-setup as being completed, etc.  Any user capable of doing these things should be able to piece together something that works on their device &mdash; and if it doesn't, most possible work-arounds would apply to many devices and thus we want to have one central spot to gather them as they are discovered. Because of this, providing a per-device answer would be duplicating a lot of information and hindering that sort of centralized list of strategies.  IMO, splitting these up would be akin to removing the list of many-device rooting tools found at the end of How do I root my Android device? I do think it's valid to leave some specific questions open, like this one: Lg G4 email verification bypass cant do anything.  It could be improved (as per my comment there), but in general something like ""I took the recommended steps X, Y, and Z but the option is still greyed out and trying A and B didn't work"" seems like a great candidate for a separate question. I of course am saying all of the above in good faith, but obviously it must be noted that I am biased because of my answers there.  (Side note, it would be awesome if someone wrote another answer with the exact details of how to erase the partition directly.)"
1930,"Coming late to this one, as I was just thinking about the same (and found this by a ""search-before-ask""): there are actually 3 tags here going very close together. Though at a first glance it looks like they all could be merged-and-synonymed, we should not do so â€“ as all 3 of them have their dedicated purpose: However, these tags should be used in XOR manner: I see no need for any combination (except for making them easier to find, maybe ;)"
