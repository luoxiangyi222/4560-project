62,"I would say [Android-2.2] or [2.2]. I have no idea what most of the code names refer to, and the phones specs I see online only give the version number, not the code name.  I use a phone with android 1.5 - I know it is 1.5, I don't know what variety of food I would refer to it by. And you could tell me in the comments, but I think most new-ish users would have no idea."
1173,"Based on the screenshot, it looks like you're using the ""collapsed"" view of your profile here at the moment. There should be a link next to your name that says more info. Click on that to expand it, which will reveal additional profile information (including your flag count). "
455,"Sounds good to me, especially since it appears users aren't using messaging to refer to email or anything else but SMS. I have proposed the other two as synonyms for sms (link). On the other hand, instant-message is proposed as a synonym for messaging, which I disagree with since again, users have only used messaging for SMS."
393,"I think for that particular question it's okay. The issue doesn't appear to be device specific, so the steps JonnyP is suggesting should help both people. If Travis had opened a new question, we almost certainly would have closed it as a duplicate of this question. That's not to say that it's okay to hijack someone else's question, but that in this case I don't think it's out-of-bounds."
778,"It looked like service was actually mostly used to refer to network issues, i.e., problems with ""phone service"".  I replaced it with connectivity in most places, services where applicable.  I think it's probably best to let service die out rather than merge with something else.  If it comes up again we should probably rename it to phone-service or something clearer."
