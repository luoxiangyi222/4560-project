1264,"I see no problem with editing ""wifi"" into ""Wi-Fi"".  If it changes search results then that should probably be brought up with SE ... hyphens should not be considered for web search IMO. However, edits should always be substantial.  If that was the only change then it was a bad edit.  See "
2119,"There's a post with the details on the SE Meta site. As far as the badges go, they are: There is a SEDE query that will calculate your current score without having to actually submit a nomination."
841,"I think you're seeing one of two behaviours that changed recently with @replies. Essentially the @reply isn't auto-completed (and is often removed when you post) if there is only one possible, unmistakable person who's the target of your post and so your @name bit would be redundant. So if you're making a comment on a question that has no answers, and it's the very first comment, then you are obviously making a comment to the questioner, so adding @name is redundant. The other thing that's changed is that when SE thinks that two people are having a conversation (when there's only two of you commenting and you're going back and forth between you) then the @name is removed too, as it's obvious who you're talking to. In these cases even though there's no @name in your comment, because it's obvious who you're talking to the person that you're talking to will still get notified that you're talking to them (for instance question askers are always notified when someone comments on their question with @naming anyone else)."
2397,"Related question Adding a template question to the Ask Question box. Perhaps such changes are not possible unless it's a global change across all SE sites Questions having the phrase I am working on app or similar need not be developer oriented. That could be the reason for asking but the question may not be off topic. For instance, in this question , if OP had said he was developing an app for that device and wanted to know the path, it wouldn't make it off topic Copy full system and data partitions of Oneplus 3T to computer or a better example How can I do development on my Android device? OP's are expected to search for relevant tags and if their question is related to development use development and if they bother to read to read the tag wiki , they would know not to ask (too much to expect, going by experience). See Does [tag:development] mean &quot;Asking for closure&quot;? I fully endorse that questions having code should raise a flag but it is related to the first bullet point and would like this to be implemented ASAP. Perhaps , moderators here could take this up Edit: Discovered this question on Meta.SE asked years before Revisiting question templates"
118,"We should email a some of the big Android Blogs an let them know about Android.SE, invite them to join and share their expertise and encourage them to share it as a resource to their readers.  I was going to just do it but maybe we should discuss a game plan. These are the android sites I frequent:"
