1311,"What circumstances is a general all-round ""yes you can"" or ""no you can't"" going to be useful? Are you just going to spend days throwing random commands at your tablet in random ways, or is there something specific that you're trying to do? What are you likely to be doing that has a chance of bricking your device? A question like ""Is there a chance rooting my device using the FancyNamed Rooting Method could brick my device?"" is answerable, (and will probably already be answered on the support thread for which ever rooting method you use). Your question as it is at the moment is very broad, has a lot of unknowns, and isn't really answerable with any answer that will stay the test of time."
120,"We might also find great benefit in sharing this with Motorola, Samsung, HTC, etc. on-line communities and forums. I think it would be a great opportunity if we started sharing answers, links, etc. at these places! The idea would be to attract users without harming what they have going on already.  What's the best way of doing this? Any other suggestions?"
2167,"Rooting, custom ROMs and the like become off-topic Definitely not. They are a genuine part of Android to many of us. While I agree that many of those questions are of poor quality â€“ that doesn't make the topic poor. I agree with Matthew here: And this is how I deal with those usually: So if OP improves the question in a way it ""becomes useful"", I immediately re-open it. If not (and as long no one starts a discussion in the comments), Roomba will take care for it. This is what we address in several places already, e.g.: Looks sufficient for me. These we often close as off-topic already, and point the OP to the corresponding forums, bug-trackers, etc. We could ""enforce"" this a bit more, maybe, via a separate post on Meta with a strong consensus declaring them ""off topic"". Still, a ""gray area"" might be left with us (how to tell when it's a ""clear bug report"" or a misbehavior caused by other reasons?) If you'd ask me for what I'd declare off-topic, I had a clear candidate though: 95% of the WhatsApp questions fall into that category (""Android independent""). But not being an expert in ""asocial media"", I keep my fingers off of those :)"
525,"Well, I've installed it on my own site. I've also got the Chrome extension to be able to use it anywhere. I think it could easily go with the Facebook and Twitter links we have already."
1374,"As I just wondered again about the development tag (and why there are only so few questions tagged such), maybe a sum-up from the above might be helpful: So here's probably the clue why there are always only few questions found using this tag: they simply get deleted :) This way we 10k+ users can use our powers to support our moderators (and) keeping our site clean -- and not only we 10k+, but all users can participate here (e.g. re-tagging does not require a 10k+ but only 500+)."
