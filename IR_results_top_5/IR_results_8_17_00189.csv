497,"This is better explained over at meta.stackoverflow.com. In short, community wikis are discouraged because they encourage ""subjective"" and ""open-ended"" questions.  But sometimes they do make sense.  For example, we have a CW on rooting phones. I believe they removed the option for users to make their own posts into a CW.  Instead, only moderators can make a post CW. 9 times out of 10, a question that ""should be CW"" probably should be closed due to being subjective or not a real question."
2035,"What is the actual use in grouping phones by chipset?  This site is for end-users, there is going to be virtually nothing relevant in common between two phones from different manufacturers than both happen to include MediaTek chips."
687,"I think only #2 is acceptable, though it might be closed as a dupe.  #1 and #5 are way too subjective, #3 is an off-topic shopping advice question, and #4 isn't a question :P.  (Note we don't take speculative questions either, which applies to most questions about 4.0 and the Fire right now.) If a contest wants to use questions here I think they still need to be real questions, real problems, asked and answerable from a user's perspective."
1210,"When you see a post here on meta titled ""2012 Community Moderator Election Results"" you'll be able to read it and know what the results were. That'll usually happen somewhere between 10 minutes and 24 hours after the election ends.  Of course, someone will probably post the results in chat between 10 and 24 seconds after the election ends. But if that's still not quick enough for you, you can download the OpenSTV software and election data and run it yourself (both will be linked to on the election page immediately after the election ends). How long that takes is up to you. "
475,"Sure. There are plenty of great topics for blog posts that can hopefully go far above and beyond being a mere reference answer for common questions If this gets traction, coordinate with rebecca@stackexchange.com and she can get a provisional blog set up."
