If you install Roboto under Linux, then when a site or program asks for Roboto, it gets ""Roboto Medium"" (which is quite heavyweight) instead of ""Roboto Regular"" (which looks normal). This is a problem with how the weights are set in the font files. This site has an explanation of how to change your font configuration to avoid the problem. Once you've added the workaround you'll notice that ASE looks a lot 'lighter' in font terms, and much easier on the eye."

2214,"Actually, though the animation is done by an event listener (as Matthew pointed out), there's no userscript needed. You can easily fool the javascript part by setting the animation duration to 0s in CSS: That did it for me at least."
