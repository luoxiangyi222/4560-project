1516,"This is quite possibly my fault (though the system should probably handle it better). At the end of last week How do you link to applications in the Android market? came up in my Close Votes queue as a dupe of How to post a link to an android market app? but after looking at the two questions, it was obvious that one had old, out-of-date and (now-)incorrect answers (one answer was by me) whereas the other one had answers that are current and correct. In my opinion the Close As Dupe vote had been cast on the wrong question (based on which one had the currently good answers) so I ""Leave Open"" voted the one and I submitted the first VtC on the other. Having explained what I did though, the system really should show what's going on in a clearer manner, and handle the situation where one is Closed as a Dupe while the other is still in the vote to close phase."
2488,"Depends on what kind of flag – and then how active the ""workers"" on the corresponding queue are. You wrote you flagged a question off-topic: if that was done via ""vote-to-close"" it ends up in the ""community review queue"", waiting for 4 more community members to agree – or disagree. Depending on that, when 5 close-votes (or less but a mod throwing the final one) have accumulated, the question is closed. As you mention your flag having been ""declined"", that rather sounds like you've flagged it for mod attention. Then it was most likely declined as it (no longer) matched, as you assumed. Talking about mod flags: No, usually not. We (mods) might decide the flag is invalid – but we usually check if it was raised in good confidence; in which case we ""dismiss"" it as ""helpful"". If you indeed marked it for mod attention: better ""vote to close"" for being off-topic (no need to raise it for a mod, our community can deal with it fine – and we mods are participating in that as well). If instead you raised a ""regular flag"" (i.e. used the ""close"" link – unlikely, as you'd need a little more rep for that), please clarify. I'm not aware of ""declining"" in that context – after all, those are not really ""flags"" but rather ""votes"" (hence ""vote to close"", not ""flag to close""). Also note you can always retract such a vote. That said, thanks for bringing it up – last but not least as a reminder for us mods to better look twice before deciding to ""decline"" a flag!"
2225,"This site is for Android users.  As a rule of thumb, do not ask any question where the question does not come from the perspective of an end user doing end user things. Marketing and charging money are obviously related, but are distinct concepts; you can do one without the other.  So whether your app is free is not relevant, and asking for feedback absolutely counts as ""market research"". As Eldarerathis notes, we also do not accept open-ended polling or anything of that kind.  Questions should be specific and should require answers that can be determined to be correct or not &mdash; not just an opinion, like feedback."
930,"I've kept an eye on this question to see if the community (via voting, commenting, or answering) held any kind of meaningful opinion on this topic, but since the activity here has been relatively flat I'm going to go ahead and add my thoughts. Please understand that this is solely my opinion on the matter. The one concern I have with questions of this nature is where factual data would be coming from. Since the app in question is closed-source any truly helpful answer is going to require either: Because of the nature of proprietary software, any answer that does not involve #1 or #2 is almost certainly going to be speculation or an educated guess. It could very well be an accurate educated guess, but there would be effectively no way for anyone to verify it as such, so the voting largely becomes a matter of ""Yeah, that sounds reasonable"" or ""No, that sounds ridiculous"". On the other hand, I completely understand your motivation and I appreciate the amount of effort and pre-question research you've clearly put into your question. Also, please don't construe my thoughts above as an indication that I think only trivial questions are appropriate for this site - that is certainly not the case at all. Further complicating this is the fact that I do recognize that it is inherently difficult to determine if either points #1 or #2 that I've noted can be met on any given question. So I suppose a related and slightly more general question could be: Is the answerability of question an acceptable metric for moderation, or no? If so, how do we make that determination? If not, at what point to we draw the line on questions that will attract and/or encourage speculative answers? From what I can tell (and correct me if I'm wrong, anyone) that seems to be the crux of the issue here."
792,"I am very unlikely to root my device, so I don't really have any skin in this game. That said, I do believe the current canonical question is getting too big and unwieldy. I think ""How do I root device X"" or, even better, ""How do I root Y class of devices"" is a good way to go. I'm concerned, though, about the different ways one can root a device. I would caution against ANY ""how do I root device X with method Y"" questions. I also agree with Flow in that these shouldn't automatically go to Community Wiki. It will take work to put this information together; the people who do should get the reward. We also have a slew of closed questions that can be re-opened and answered. That should make the askers happy. (Although that's not a reason to do this.)"
