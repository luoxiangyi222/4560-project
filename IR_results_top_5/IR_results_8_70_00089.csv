1222,"Ok, now I have got over losing (I think), time for this. I just wanted to personally thank everyone that took part and voted, and also every one of the 16 people that chose me as their preferred candidate. If we ever have another election, then maybe I can win this time - maybe more people will vote for me. Congratulations to the two winners, Flow and onik - well done :) If I ever get caught up in my thoughts again, direct me to this post please - and thanks to Izzy for calming me down Yesterday on the chat :) You never know - maybe two moderators will drop out for some reason and I will get instated ;) Just let me say thanks to everyone involved - and congrats to the winners."
2411,"I don't think there's any way to get a notification, but after a question is migrated, the original question gets a banner to say what site it was migrated to, with a link to the question on the destination site."
846,"As a new user i know i don't have something to say.
But personally i had never heard of this site before Android Guys wrote an article about your competition, and it was perfect because i had a question which i have looked for in the past month and haven't found any answers too. And suddenly i had a chance to both get a answer on my question and a chance to win a tablet. It was a win win for me, and since i made my user here, i have tried to help a couple of users, and i am pretty sure i will stick here for a good while, because i like the way the site is build and how it is working. So even though i'm a new user, and don't have anything to say, then you should know that the audio competition worked on me :) [off topic]BTW: how do you run this site, there aren't any commercials on the site. Where do you get the money to run the server and buy the prices in the competitions? [/off topic] "
2363,"This site isn't a forum. There aren't ""follow-ups"" here: there are questions and answers. If you want to ask a question, use the Ask question button. If you know the answer to a question, write it in Your answer under that question. It doesn't matter how relevant it is: if it's not an answer to the question, it doesn't belong there. People who know the answer to your question won't see it if it's not posted as a question, and they can't help you, because you can't answer an answer. Running the site in this format is what makes it a repository of information that's easy to find and navigate, without the problems of thread hijacking and ""me too"" posts that you get on a forum. It means that people who know about the thing you're asking about will see your question on the front page of the site: you're not relying on them looking on the n-th page of a thread about a related question that they're not going to look at because they already know the answer. The tour is a really brief introduction to all of this. You get a badge for reading it, but more importantly, you also learn how to get your questions answered by experts."
2285,"This close reason is designed to let people know not to ask about general phone issues or generic hardware issues, rather than the much broader ""something not in scope"".  We get quite a lot of these questions, and approximately 0.1% of their askers bother to read the help center.  A slightly larger number read the close reason, so I'd say it's helpful. We also tend to get people who argue based on things like ""well I'm using an Android phone with Sprint, so Sprint's coverage areas are relevant!"" and this shuts them down much more effectively than the help center. Unless you have an idea for a more useful close reason to take the spot of this one, I don't see any reason to take action to remove it."
