917,"The best you can really do currently is to create a new room and then invite the user to that room. You can also leave a link to the room as a comment on their post if you want. The automated chat link will also create a public room, so from that regard it's essentially the same (and you can give it whatever title you want). One downside is that the auto-inserted link will import the comments from the post into the chat room when it's created. Creating your own room beforehand will not do this, but if you are pre-emptively setting up a chat with someone then there is likely not going to be a long comment thread to import anyway, I'd imagine. This has also been discussed on Meta Stack Overflow."
822,"I normally save the &lt; kbd > tags for actual hardware buttons (or at least buttons that are normally hardware even if they're sometimes soft) like Power, Menu, Home, Back, etc. For menu options and clicking on items on the screen I'd normally either bold them (or for long options like descriptions on tick boxes ""enclose them in quotes"". So for your example I'd say Settings -> About phone -> Android version Or Settings -> Display -> tick ""Auto-rotate screen"" Or giving a Xoom the ""three-fingered salute"" would be hold down Power + Volume Up at the same time."
1049,"I don't know, whereas screen and display were really just different ways of saying the same thing,and were proper synonyms. These all seem like specific cases where a specific aspect or behaviour is being asked about. I think people are likely to search for ""screen timeout"" or ""screen brightness"" so these are useful tags. Though as the one question in Screensaver makes clear, that whole idea just doesn't make sense in Android at the moment, so it's debatable whether we need that tag at all. But if things like Android x86 take off and we start seeing Android in more devices like desktop-style machines, or when Android is running devices with expensive screens that are permanently connected to the mains power, like TVs, set top boxes and Ouyas then screensavers could become a real thing for Android in the future."
1403,"Keep the wiki excerpt short and focused on what the tag means on this site. For instance, email doesn't need to describe what electronic mail is, but rather it should explain that it is for question about email on Android devices in general and the built-in default email app in particular. Also, don't include an instruction to ""see the info link below"" to direct the reader to the full tag wiki. While that works on the tag info page, the wiki excerpt is displayed in multiple other places (like the mouseover window) where there is no ""info"" link for the reader to click."
1335,This can really only mean that your computer's system clock is set incorrectly. We work on the assumption that a visitors system clock is correct; see this answer of mine for some reasoning behind that.
