1365,"Done.  I'm going to double check right now for any ""remote access"" questions that might need to be retagged. Edit: remote-control and remote-access are still a bit messy.  I'm not sure if we should merge them or what.  I don't think there are many questions about using devices as TV remotes so fortunately that isn't complicating things :)"
778,"It looked like service was actually mostly used to refer to network issues, i.e., problems with ""phone service"".  I replaced it with connectivity in most places, services where applicable.  I think it's probably best to let service die out rather than merge with something else.  If it comes up again we should probably rename it to phone-service or something clearer."
886,"Nope.  Once you create a bounty, you lose that rep forever.  I think you used to be able to award it to yourself but it ""didn't count"", and now it's just the more sensible solution of not letting you award it to yourself at all. If someone else is able to help or independently discovers the same fix as you, you may want to consider giving them the bounty.  Otherwise just let it expire &mdash; if it does without you awarding it, half the rep will go to the highest-scoring answer if it's at +2 or more, if there is such an answer.  (If not, no one gets any.)"
1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
1748,"I'm not totally against this idea, but it would often require the user to research something they may not have been prepared to.  Any barrier to posting has to be carefully considered so quality is balanced with ease of use, since the longer it takes the more likely the user is to go somewhere else.  It's also definitely not up to just the user to define how a tag will be used on the site, and we do have some guidelines and particular formats for types of tags."
