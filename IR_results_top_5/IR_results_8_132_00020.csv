2387,"The bounty amount is deducted from your reputation when the bounty starts, not when it's awarded. For the particular example you mentioned, you can see exactly what happened on the reputation tab of that user's profile. They started with 1 like everyone else, got +100 of association bonus, and then spent it on the bounty to get back to 1 rep. They also got an upvote on the question taking them up to 6. Spending one's association bonus to bounty one's first question on a new site is pretty common but it's quite unfortunate, because you have to get all the way back up to 110 reputation before you can answer protected questions."
2411,"I don't think there's any way to get a notification, but after a question is migrated, the original question gets a banner to say what site it was migrated to, with a link to the question on the destination site."
1277,"Per this answer from Jeff Atwood at Meta Stack Exchange: Expletives are not acceptable behavior on meta or any other Stack Overflow site. If you can't effectively communicate what you need to say without resorting to lowest common denominator cursing, then keep it to yourself. If you use expletives, you will get a warning. If you continue to use expletives, you will be placed on timed suspension. While Jeff has left Stack Exchange this is still official policy. It would also be considered a violation of the Be Nice policy 1. I would suggest that profanity, especially if directed at someone, falls under &quot;Rudeness and belittling language&quot;, while run-of-the-mill &quot;blue&quot; language just in general is covered under &quot;Don't be a jerk - Inappropriate language or attention&quot;. (&quot;Vulgar terms&quot; is specifically called out.)"
475,"Sure. There are plenty of great topics for blog posts that can hopefully go far above and beyond being a mere reference answer for common questions If this gets traction, coordinate with rebecca@stackexchange.com and she can get a provisional blog set up."
277,"It looks like Bryan Denny's How do I root my phone? would be a perfect place to consolidate this, and a great resource to point all the rooting question-askers at. If he's happy for his answer to be Community Wiki'd, then it could be treated as a shared resource to put all the info in, the same way that the ""When is my phone getting [OS]"" questions are pointed to the two ""When will my phone get the Android 2.2 update (FroYo)?"" (and Gingerbread) questions started by Al Everett. That way all of the normal ""How Do I Root"" questions can be closed and pointed to Bryan's question, and the more unusual edge-cases can be treated on a case-by-case basis to see if they'll stand as their own separate question (but probably still with a link back to the main rooting question),"
