2036,"I wouldn't say ""nothing relevant in common"" as Matthew put it (especially with MTK, which has its specifics). But what I agree with: This site is for end-users, and the majority of end-users probably has no clue whether their device features a mt6582 or rk3066 chip – and if they do, they can specify such in the question's text. A tag is not very useful if ignored by the majority even if it would fit – so I agree with Matthew we don't want/need those on an end-user site (it would look different if we were a techie-centric site, sure)."
794,"I'd say it's fine.  Wanting your services consolidated is a perfectly OK criterion for potential solutions, as is not using a web app. Things to note:"
2176,"I agree. As the 1+1 uses oneplus-one, I'd say oneplus-two should be the one to stay. There's no oneplus-1 synonym, so I guess we don't want oneplus-2 stay as such?"
1653,What browser/OS are you using? It shows in the right place inside the grey bar for me on Win7 Sp1 x86 with Internet Explorer 9 and Firefox 26.
2055,"It sounds like you want to post your results as a ""question"".  That's ... not right.  To put it simply,  questions should be about Android software-specific concerns, or concerns uniquely related to devices that are running Android.  We do occasionally have general hardware questions, but those are the exception rather than the rule -- coming, as you say, from being broadly useful.  They must also be based in expertise that you could expect some Android power users to acquire -- not electrical engineers and so on -- as this site is by and for Android Enthusiasts."
311,"I don't think that's necessary. For one thing it's not a change that would be all that universal. What use would, say, English.SE have for QR codes? Besides, the new web market puts QR codes right on the page. It's only a couple of clicks to get the URL for the image and add it to a message. "
785,"I have added ""Roboto"" to the font stack for the site(both main and Meta). For now I'm not using it as a web font like I did with Droid Sans, since I'm not too clear on the re-distribution licensing.  Roboto should show up on handheld after the next production build. Meanwhile if you want to see it on your desktop, you can download the font manually. "
823,"I think as long as it's clear you're good to do whatever you want.  Like GAThrawn I would leave the keyboard buttons for actual buttons, though I tend to use bold or nothing for them myself.  I also tend to use inline code for menu items. I suppose in an ideal world we would have a standard, or perhaps site-specific ways to indicate various Android UI elements, but I don't think it's particularly important."
326,"Better to say ""not at this time"" or ""not that I have found"". Because there very well might not be an app that does what the asker wants. Maybe no one has built it. Maybe it's just not possible with the state of the OS and hardware. At least, as it currently exists. It would be better if askers described what problem they're trying to solve rather than asking for an app. There might be solutions they haven't considered. This shows up one of the problems with shopping recommendations. Personally, I have come around to thinking that ""I need an app that does X, Y, or Z"" should be closed as off-topic, while a better question would be ""How can I do X, Y and Z"". I mean, unless I have actually used an app that does exactly what they're asking for, in order to answer their question I'm just going to the Market and searching on some of their keywords. They can do that. Instead of crafting their own good search, they've finagled me into doing it for them. This site is about helping Android Enthusiasts use their devices, not helping people learn to search."
61,"Yes, I find QR links very useful, especially when there are no many barcode scanners around. However, There should be a standard for these ""Here is an App that will help"" posts, just so we aren't A) leaching images, B) not shutting out users who want to see the app without having to go to the market place. Below, I've listed the way I've been linking apps to answers, including how not to leach images (IMPORTANT) because we don't want to get in trouble, now do we? For QR images, I've been using the following method: 1) Find the app on (marketplace e.g. AppBrain) you want to share
 2) Find the QR Code button, and locate the QR code.
 3) Copy the URL of the QR code
 The URL is
 Which is basically  If you use the Image upload tool on the post answer, you can use the image URL to reupload the image to imgur.com
 That way, you get the right QR code, generated from a reliable source, and you don't steal bandwidth. 4) MAKE SURE YOU HREF LINK TO APPBRAIN AT THE SAME TIME
So annoying when you get a QR link, and no web reference to what it is (I'm not sure what other services use, I use AppBrain for a lot of my stuff, but if you know the marketplace URL, just go from step 3 and hardcode the charts.api link yourself) (Freehand circles)"
