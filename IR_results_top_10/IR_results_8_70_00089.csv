1222,"Ok, now I have got over losing (I think), time for this. I just wanted to personally thank everyone that took part and voted, and also every one of the 16 people that chose me as their preferred candidate. If we ever have another election, then maybe I can win this time - maybe more people will vote for me. Congratulations to the two winners, Flow and onik - well done :) If I ever get caught up in my thoughts again, direct me to this post please - and thanks to Izzy for calming me down Yesterday on the chat :) You never know - maybe two moderators will drop out for some reason and I will get instated ;) Just let me say thanks to everyone involved - and congrats to the winners."
2411,"I don't think there's any way to get a notification, but after a question is migrated, the original question gets a banner to say what site it was migrated to, with a link to the question on the destination site."
846,"As a new user i know i don't have something to say.
But personally i had never heard of this site before Android Guys wrote an article about your competition, and it was perfect because i had a question which i have looked for in the past month and haven't found any answers too. And suddenly i had a chance to both get a answer on my question and a chance to win a tablet. It was a win win for me, and since i made my user here, i have tried to help a couple of users, and i am pretty sure i will stick here for a good while, because i like the way the site is build and how it is working. So even though i'm a new user, and don't have anything to say, then you should know that the audio competition worked on me :) [off topic]BTW: how do you run this site, there aren't any commercials on the site. Where do you get the money to run the server and buy the prices in the competitions? [/off topic] "
2363,"This site isn't a forum. There aren't ""follow-ups"" here: there are questions and answers. If you want to ask a question, use the Ask question button. If you know the answer to a question, write it in Your answer under that question. It doesn't matter how relevant it is: if it's not an answer to the question, it doesn't belong there. People who know the answer to your question won't see it if it's not posted as a question, and they can't help you, because you can't answer an answer. Running the site in this format is what makes it a repository of information that's easy to find and navigate, without the problems of thread hijacking and ""me too"" posts that you get on a forum. It means that people who know about the thing you're asking about will see your question on the front page of the site: you're not relying on them looking on the n-th page of a thread about a related question that they're not going to look at because they already know the answer. The tour is a really brief introduction to all of this. You get a badge for reading it, but more importantly, you also learn how to get your questions answered by experts."
2285,"This close reason is designed to let people know not to ask about general phone issues or generic hardware issues, rather than the much broader ""something not in scope"".  We get quite a lot of these questions, and approximately 0.1% of their askers bother to read the help center.  A slightly larger number read the close reason, so I'd say it's helpful. We also tend to get people who argue based on things like ""well I'm using an Android phone with Sprint, so Sprint's coverage areas are relevant!"" and this shuts them down much more effectively than the help center. Unless you have an idea for a more useful close reason to take the spot of this one, I don't see any reason to take action to remove it."
1028,"The interesting thing is how many questions of this kind are asked by first-timers (feels like 95% up). It's rarely one with rep coming up with such a question. Next interesting fact is how often the OP shows up afterwards: I'd say 80% up do never show up again, 10% just on the very first day to prove their point and destroy doubts, if possible. Which makes it quite suspicious. Don't take me wrong: The information is freely available if you know the sources, you don't even have to identify yourself to get it. That's why I'd say ""big fish"" never turns up like that (""big fish"" not only knows where the food is, but also ""how to get the crab out of its shell""). So what's left must be either ""small fish"" (those who just ""found"" a single device -- which is not worth the big research and maybe little to big monetary investment), and people of ""legitimate interest"". Not being interested in the former, this leaves the latter. Who are they? People like t0mm13b, who are simply technically interested, or willing to help ""friends in need"" (i.e. people they know). These usually already have a higher rep -- and I see no reason to hide things from them. But then there's the last remaining group: those without any rep, who just f***ed off their device (in this case -- call me bad -- it's a good point to start learning not to fiddle with things you don't understand -- or to be more careful with your sensitive stuff, sorry), or in fact had ""bad stuff happening"" (the brothers little daughter playing with the... how did she get her hands on it?). So my opinion on this: I go with t0mm13b. If technically possible, real sensitive stuff should require a certain rep (at least 1,000+). Everybody below that level could still get the ""obvious legitimate solutions"", such as to specify their Google credentials on a messed-up pattern lock, or see their local Rabbi1... oops, service technician. If it's really your device, you have the papers to prove -- and the solution to your problem is reached faster when taking those papers and looking up a service point (you can return successfully just within minutes) but to prove the legitimacy to ""us"". If it's really a legitimate thing, (s)he will do so. For a petty thief, even this little effort will be too much -- and if it requires more afford, (s)he probably doesn't find it as worth the next time. 1SYLOR is the term for getting sensitive information on e.g. our judaism stack (See Your Local Orthodox Rabbi. Meaning: This is real sensitive (and maybe personal) stuff which should be explained by an expert face-to-face: He can identify you and tell you what you really should know -- as opposed to what you say you need to know -- guess you get my point."
41,"I would say yes. Certainly for built-in and Google applications. For more obscure application maybe not, but those are less likely to get answers anyways"
504,"Your question is a bit ""rant-y"". I'm sure I understand your frustration; too often these damn carriers ruin what is otherwise an elegant phone OS. If your question is really ""how can I submit an official bug report with Sprint?"" then please edit your question to make that clearer (and remove the ranty bits). Knowing how to get past mainline tech support to really report a bug is something other hardcore Android users would want to know. (In fact, a Community Wiki question with answers for each of the carriers would be even more useful.) If that's not really your question, then please make it clearer what your question actually is. And in either case leave out the rant. (As it says right in the FAQ under ""What should I not ask here"" is: ""it is a rant disguised as a question"".)"
1331,"This question has been asked multiple times at Meta Stack Overflow for a variety of projects/tools/libraries. (Here's probably the definitive question and answer: Is it okay to use Stack Overflow as the support forum for a product or project? ) Part of the problem is that there's a good chunk of ""support"" that falls outside of the realm of what Android Stack Exchange is about. Feature requests, for instance. Bug reports is another. Those questions, should they get asked here, will be ruthlessly downvoted, closed, and deleted. That's not the sort of experience you want your users to have. That said, I think it's a good idea for you to let your users know that you actively monitor the tag for your app(s) here. Just don't try to make this the ""official support forum"" for it."
1473,"I think you are correct in saying that the Android update questions are not really a good fit for this site.  They are excepted because of how broadly useful they are; we did, and still do, get hundreds of questions asking when Device X will get an android update. Yes, very probably. See #2 No, there's no SE site where you could ask this.  Do see Where can I ask questions that aren&#39;t Android Enthusiast questions? I agree, the site title does not necessarily give a good idea about how the Stack Exchange platform works and the kind of questions we accept.  You should read it as an SE site for Android enthusiasts, rather than as a general website for them. Your rephrased question is the same question.  Just because questions without problems behind them are not normally accepted doesn't mean all questions with problems behind them will be accepted.  The problem is, as noted, that it's a list question."
