557,"We shouldcan only create tags when there are posts to put them against. For one thing, no one may actually ask a question about that device. For another, the Stack Exchange software removes tags that don't have any questions associated with them after some number of days. (Four, I think.) So even if we didcould set up tags ahead of time it's likely they'd get deleted before someone used them."
2228,"It's worth considering the type of answer that one will expect to receive. On a development forum like SO, one will likely receive a very technical response.
On a softer (is that the right word to use) forum one will likely receive a less hard-core techie response. Thus, there is merit in having this cross over and even an argument for identical questions on both forums as they'll be asking them in different contexts."
813,"It's not supposed to be a tablet. It's just a notice panel, like the one used on this site's header. "
238,"Sounds like something that would be quite useful. If it were one App per Answer, then each app could be individually voted up/down as well as comments left against it...so each answer in itself is useful..."
1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
608,"On the one hand I would prefer one site per answer so that we can vote
  on them individually and the good ones can rise to the top. This also
  makes sense since it's impossible to create a single definitive answer
  (some editors will find a particular site useful and others won't). Well, there are a few problems with these questions. Older answers will by default have more votes than newer answers, so for a question that's been open for months, you can't judge anything about the quality of a site/answer by the number of votes (unless they're into the negative, in which case it's a useless answer that misleads visitors who don't understand our voting and should probably be deleted). Once the answers overflow a page, though, you get into a situation
  where new answers never get seen or voted on, since few people go to
  the next page. I think the StackExchange team have tried to combat this effect over time. Unlike us, who've all been here long enough and clicked enough links to change all the defaults, new users coming to those pages will see a semi-random ordering of the answers (I think there's an activity bias to the randomness) so no two visitors should see the same ""first page"" of answers. I'd be tempted to say that if we keep these type of questions on the main site, then rather than treating them as a popularity contest between the answers, we do something more like the other ""community resource"" questions (like the ""when will my phone get updated"", ""how do I root"" type-stuff). So we make (almost) no obvious judgement on the quality of the sites and edit them all into one community wiki answer by category. (obviously the quality bar of each site will now be whether a user thinks they're good enough to nominate, after that all linked sites are treated equally)."
2383,"We don't have review audits on this site. While the second one does look like the random garbage of an autogenerated edit for an audit, it's a real edit someone suggested. We do occasionally get rubbish edits like this, and more often spam edits like the first one you linked. Like flagging posts as spam, rejecting edits as ""spam or vandalism"" feeds the suggester's info (IP address etc.) into the anti-spam system, making it harder for them to come back and keep wasting our time with spam edits."
2345,"Not being a gamer I've never heard about Freedom, so I cannot talk about that. LP on the other hand has some very good and ""ethical"" features, but one can be very much tempted using a few of them in an unethical way (which is why I stopped using it years ago, after having given it a short try). It's sometimes a bit too tempting, so I have no clear ""advice"" here. Nevertheless, a possible approach could be: That's quite ""black and white"", and the hard part is where to draw the line. As phrased in my bullet points, there's a wide ""no man's land"" in between which is likely to lead to debates on ""why is this one closed and the other one not"". So while I'm pretty sure about the ""NO"" part, I don't know if we should vote for the other half."
2327,"The point on the question from the headline is about changing the date/time in one app, not about piracy. The whole text is about piracy, and that is what makes the question a bad example for the real question here. In principle, you will often encounter questions with a technical and neutral question, which has one paragraph of motivation which is not ethical. Like when this question would be framed as Introduction: I have a trial version of an app and like to continue using it after the trial period. Question (about date/time settings): To do so, I would like to change date and time on the phone, but only for this app. Is there a way to do it without changing the source of the app? While other cases are more clear: how can I continue using a trial version after the trial period? Any hint welcome, I just do not want to change the time for every app on the phone to do so. Actual question: How do I evade the trial period? In the end, you should not forget, that a question about how to evade the trial period in this way even comes handy for the app author, which learns how users avoid his restriction in the app. The knowledge is there anyway and if it is not answered here, it will be answered elsewhere. But here it is visible for everybody, including the victim of the piracy. So it is kind of full disclosure (in computer security terms) to have an answer here, which can be used by the next author of a trial app to avoid making it too easy to keep using the app after the trial period. And then there is @liljoshu's point: Where do the ethics begin and where do they stop? Avoiding trial periods costs the author money, so it is not ethical. What about ad blocking? And finally, some app authors are making money by selling your data. Do you want to prevent people from asking how they can protect their data against apps, which sell your data? "
441,"If these tags are worth keeping, then the Windows and Windows XP tags should probably be kept separate.  I know there was at least one question about the Galaxy S drivers for Windows 7 x64, which are different from the 32-bit XP drivers, for example.  The one question tagged Windows XP involves driver issues, which might be specific to XP.  There's another question about having a PC rebroadcast WiFi for a phone, which is Windows 7 specific.   Edit: I withdraw the below.

Personally, I don't think these tags have any value.  Information about what OS you're using or a problem using a device connected to an OS should be in the question and stay out of the tags.  Most of the time it's incidental information not useful for classification, and the rest of the time it's a classification that I don't think is needed."
