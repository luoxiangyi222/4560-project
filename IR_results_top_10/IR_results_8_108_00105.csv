1469,"No, those questions aren't on-topic.  The reason is fairly straightforward &mdash; this site is for end-users.  Curiosity is a valid reason for asking a question, but at the end of the day we expect questions and answers to be applicable in some way to a problem faced by an end user. The closest we get to your last question, for example, would be when an advanced user wants to have an extra script or app run on startup.  This would be a valid question for us, and the answer might involved a partial description of the boot process, but laying out the whole process in detail is going to be a lot of extraneous information that our audience simply cannot make use of. Your questions might be on-topic on Stack Overflow but again, it would be best if you could connect them to a problem.  If you were creating your own ROM and modifying boot if not the source code then there would certainly be many reasons to ask those sorts of questions. I think your GPS question is not the most solidly in-scope, but acceptable.  As an end user, you made an observation about something your phone was doing, which resulted in the question."
2089,"I too think it is pretty much off-topic. Example 1: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one should I buy? We simply can't know the expectations and parameters of choice of any person. Example 2: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one is
better? Since utility of a good is not quantifiable, the answers are going to be pretty much subjective and opinion-based. Example 3: I want a phone with following specs: blablabla Can you guys suggest any? There are websites that find phones with the desired specs already."

29,"I think a lot of good points have already been made here but after taking a look at the existing questions, I really think people need to take a good hard look at this: Edit - I missed a few, and more just keep coming and coming... Guys, this is seriously awful.  We are just one day into the beta and out of 109 questions on the site, 22 of them (over 20%) are about which apps are ""good/bad/best"" - yikes! Worse, almost none of them are Community Wiki, so people are actually gaining rep for asking and answering the most mundane and subjective questions imaginable. I think this list very dramatically illustrates the problem with allowing these questions.  There's no end to them.  What's the best compass app?  What's the best flashlight app?  What's the best ukelele simulation app?  Gah! Is this what we're going to be, just a glorified review site?  Is it really that hard to just go to the market and read the reviews?  The Android developers have already built us this beautiful rating and review system that you can access right on your phone.  We don't need this fluff. Please, please, let's start closing these questions.  At the very least close them until we have moderators who can properly wikify them, but even then, I don't want to see people's 1-line recommendations taking up 20% of the site.  This is turning into a land grab with everybody wanting to own one of the big bad 500+ upvoted poll questions.  If we don't nip this in the bud, it's going to bite us hard later on. P.S. I'm not saying every question about an app is bad.  Here are two that are fine: In the first example, somebody is looking for a very specific app and has provided criteria to significantly narrow down the list of candidates.  In the second example, the author is asking for a comparison of two specific apps.  I see no problem with either of these. I just don't want to see two hundred ""Post your favourite [X] app"" polls by the time we hit public beta."
2187,"A duplicate answer is an answer that does not add any information not alerady in an older answer. Note that the above text is only an example, but you need to provide the link to the original answer, if you want quicker mod action and/or don't want mods to search for a possibly long time to find the original answer because they have to do other things too and you are uselessly delaying them with that. At the bottom of every answer, just above the comment section, there are at least these 3 buttons: ""share"", ""edit"" and ""flag"" (if this isn't there you couldn't flag in the first place.) Then, go to the duplicate answer and do step 5 (or 5.2, if you managed to keep the flag window open all that time). A duplicate answer is a duplicate, no matter when it is posted. It just needs to be posted at least 1 second later than the original one in order to be recognizable as a duplicate."
2339,"I agree with the sentiment here, that if someone obviously is being unethical, then the question should be closed. BUT, then the other side of me says, this is all computer science, right? The information that you share to help me hack an app illegally may help someone else tremendously in another way. It's like if I'm a gunshop. A person comes in and wants his gun fixed. I don't give him a form and grill him to make sure he won't shoot anybody in order for me to fix it. I fix it, and if I have suspicion that he's acting illegally I will notify the police. He may be an honest hunter. But if I refuse to fix the gun, or tell him what he needs to fix it, he will go away disappointed and without a solution.
So, I'm not sure that we should be really suspicious of possibly unethical questions. Provide the information, and it's up to the person to be ethical with it."
1013,"It seems to me that the answer you refer to is trying to answer the question behind your question. It is, at least, an attempt to answer some aspect of your question. By and large, Moderators are going to be conservative about deleting answers; they'll only do so if it is an obvious non-answer. Frankly, I think your question is off-topic. Certainly it's not an Android-specific issue. All that considered, it's the community that decides. You've received an answer and you've commented that you don't think it is and your rationale. That's good. The community seems to not agree. Re-flagging in hopes of getting a Moderator to issue a different decision is a little disingenuous. (There's an obvious parallel to a child not getting the answer she wants from one parent and going to ask the other parent the same question.) That you've raised the issue here on Meta is fine, as any discussion that can help improve the site is welcome."

61,"Yes, I find QR links very useful, especially when there are no many barcode scanners around. However, There should be a standard for these ""Here is an App that will help"" posts, just so we aren't A) leaching images, B) not shutting out users who want to see the app without having to go to the market place. Below, I've listed the way I've been linking apps to answers, including how not to leach images (IMPORTANT) because we don't want to get in trouble, now do we? For QR images, I've been using the following method: 1) Find the app on (marketplace e.g. AppBrain) you want to share
 2) Find the QR Code button, and locate the QR code.
 3) Copy the URL of the QR code
 The URL is
 Which is basically  If you use the Image upload tool on the post answer, you can use the image URL to reupload the image to imgur.com
 That way, you get the right QR code, generated from a reliable source, and you don't steal bandwidth. 4) MAKE SURE YOU HREF LINK TO APPBRAIN AT THE SAME TIME
So annoying when you get a QR link, and no web reference to what it is (I'm not sure what other services use, I use AppBrain for a lot of my stuff, but if you know the marketplace URL, just go from step 3 and hardcode the charts.api link yourself) (Freehand circles)"
370,"We don't want questions phrased as: ""What is an app that does A, B, and C?"" We want questions phrased as ""How do I do X, Y, and Z?"" The answer to the latter may very well be an app, but then again maybe not. When you ask for an app, you've already got a solution in mind. Answers to that are generally only going to help you. We're more interested in questions that may help many people."
