62,"I would say [Android-2.2] or [2.2]. I have no idea what most of the code names refer to, and the phones specs I see online only give the version number, not the code name.  I use a phone with android 1.5 - I know it is 1.5, I don't know what variety of food I would refer to it by. And you could tell me in the comments, but I think most new-ish users would have no idea."
1173,"Based on the screenshot, it looks like you're using the ""collapsed"" view of your profile here at the moment. There should be a link next to your name that says more info. Click on that to expand it, which will reveal additional profile information (including your flag count). "
455,"Sounds good to me, especially since it appears users aren't using messaging to refer to email or anything else but SMS. I have proposed the other two as synonyms for sms (link). On the other hand, instant-message is proposed as a synonym for messaging, which I disagree with since again, users have only used messaging for SMS."
393,"I think for that particular question it's okay. The issue doesn't appear to be device specific, so the steps JonnyP is suggesting should help both people. If Travis had opened a new question, we almost certainly would have closed it as a duplicate of this question. That's not to say that it's okay to hijack someone else's question, but that in this case I don't think it's out-of-bounds."
778,"It looked like service was actually mostly used to refer to network issues, i.e., problems with ""phone service"".  I replaced it with connectivity in most places, services where applicable.  I think it's probably best to let service die out rather than merge with something else.  If it comes up again we should probably rename it to phone-service or something clearer."
2395,"If you have a better answer, post it. Explain what should and should not be done, and why. Downvote any wrong answers you see. Comment on their flaws when applicable. But don't try to change someone else's answer to say what they did not intend to say. Respect the original author even while disagreeing with them.  Contrary to your claim, there are many dangerously wrong answers on other sites, such as Stack Overflow. Following someone's wrong advice regarding information security can be much worse than destroying a phone. Those answers still exist. When there's is a dangerous misconception around, it's better for it to be voiced and refuted than never be voiced."
1261,"A question should never be closed as ""too localized"" unless it is at least 1 month old. Even if it looks quite localized on a first glance, that could be due to the phrasing -- while under-the-hood a real important problem is addressed. This might not be obvious during the first hours/days, but later on due to increased views, or a re-phrasing, or some comments... If you feel 1 month is too much, please say so in your comments. But IMHO we should not drop that margin below a week for sure."
696,"This is great. Any way we can create a system message or do something else to nudge users to dig thru the old unanswered questions and submit them here? Or how about... can you sort old unanswered questions by view count (I can't) to see what garners interest today? I'd like to maybe nominate 10 or 15 old questions for this initiative &amp; attach a ""bounty"" -- answer a question, throw your name in the hat for a Kindle Fire. Also, I don't see why moderators can't be eligible here."
1682,"The +100 rep association bonus is not counted in the protection algorithm. The post notice states (emphasis added): To answer it, you must have earned at least 10 reputation on this site. and the ""on this site"" part is actually quite literal, though not entirely clear. Therefore, looking at your rep history, you've got +100 for the association bonus and +5 for an upvote on one of your questions. That nets you 5 rep from your activities on this site, which is still shy of the 10 needed. There is also a more detailed explanation of the ""protected"" status on Meta Stack Exchange, for reference. In this specific case, the view count of the question is pretty low, so I'm going to remove the protection. It looks like it was applied because it picked up a bunch of non-answers within the first 24 hours, but then the views petered off after that."
2012,"These questions are not considered to be within our scope: Please note the following topics are expressly off-topic here:
   ...   They were determined to be too problematic because they generally lack lasting value, often attract spam, and often end up being more popularity contests than anything else. Such questions are also sometimes viewed as inherently being ""help me Google this"", and therefore don't mesh well with the goal of building a knowledge repository outside of providing a link or pointer to elsewhere. You could consider asking for recommendations in chat, if you'd like."
