2187,"A duplicate answer is an answer that does not add any information not alerady in an older answer. Note that the above text is only an example, but you need to provide the link to the original answer, if you want quicker mod action and/or don't want mods to search for a possibly long time to find the original answer because they have to do other things too and you are uselessly delaying them with that. At the bottom of every answer, just above the comment section, there are at least these 3 buttons: ""share"", ""edit"" and ""flag"" (if this isn't there you couldn't flag in the first place.) Then, go to the duplicate answer and do step 5 (or 5.2, if you managed to keep the flag window open all that time). A duplicate answer is a duplicate, no matter when it is posted. It just needs to be posted at least 1 second later than the original one in order to be recognizable as a duplicate."
2373,"The founder of Stack Exchange thinks affiliate links should be treated as spam. Unfortunately, Stack Exchange has not clarified their policy further. To me, they should be immediately removed and the user warned. Things could very easily escalate to edit wars (I want to use my affiliate code, not theirs) and spammy behavior (I'm going to add my affiliate code to this answer that I had nothing to do with...it won't change the text...nobody will care). It's a bit of dirty pool, that. By the way, any links to Amazon.com are re-written to include Stack Exchange's affiliate code. That said, of course, I think it's not unreasonable to have a couple of affiliate links in your profile, but only there."

326,"Better to say ""not at this time"" or ""not that I have found"". Because there very well might not be an app that does what the asker wants. Maybe no one has built it. Maybe it's just not possible with the state of the OS and hardware. At least, as it currently exists. It would be better if askers described what problem they're trying to solve rather than asking for an app. There might be solutions they haven't considered. This shows up one of the problems with shopping recommendations. Personally, I have come around to thinking that ""I need an app that does X, Y, or Z"" should be closed as off-topic, while a better question would be ""How can I do X, Y and Z"". I mean, unless I have actually used an app that does exactly what they're asking for, in order to answer their question I'm just going to the Market and searching on some of their keywords. They can do that. Instead of crafting their own good search, they've finagled me into doing it for them. This site is about helping Android Enthusiasts use their devices, not helping people learn to search."
2379,"The post that you wanted to edit looked like this: This is what I got so far, it might not be the most efficient way to do it.  pm list packages >/storage/emulated/0/Apps.txt
  diff --unchanged-line-format= --old-line-format= --new-line-format='%L' /storage/emulated/0/BaselineApps.txt /storage/emulated/0/Apps.txt | sed 's/^[^:]*://' >/storage/emulated/0/NewApps.txt I suggest, instead of using whitespaces in every line, use &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;/pre&gt; at the beginning of first line and end of last line. E.g.  &lt;pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt; If you're editing the text which falls between a list, simply add one whitespace before &lt;pre&gt; to align the whole preformatted text with the list. E.g. This is what I got so far, it might not be the most efficient way to do it. "

365,"I'm not entirely sure how the tag wiki privileges work, to be honest, but based on the rep listings (for a beta site): Technically speaking, then, it appears that 1500 rep is not actually enough to edit wikis without approval. This does seem a bit confusing, though, since you could seemingly approve your own edit based on the by-the-letter description of the 1500 rep priv. I don't know if it actually works out that way, though..."
1272,"I usually prefer wi-fi. But seeing that most people prefer WiFi, I will consider this in my next edits.  Off-topic, I don't edits just to change the wi-fi text only. I also consider if the sentences can be rephrased, or added with punctuations for easier readability."
1323,"You can edit questions and answers, but they go to a queue, from which moderators and users with enough reputation (over 2000) can accept, discard or improve your edits. From the Edit questions and answers privilege page: Reviewing suggested edits In addition, users with this privilege level also get access to the
  suggested edits queue. The queue has a list of posts which have been
  edited upon by users who don't have edit privileges. This queue can be
  accessed over at the suggested edits tab in the review section. Users
  with this privilege level get access to the Low Quality Posts list
  where they can improved the low quality posts, or suggest they are
  deleted."
29,"I think a lot of good points have already been made here but after taking a look at the existing questions, I really think people need to take a good hard look at this: Edit - I missed a few, and more just keep coming and coming... Guys, this is seriously awful.  We are just one day into the beta and out of 109 questions on the site, 22 of them (over 20%) are about which apps are ""good/bad/best"" - yikes! Worse, almost none of them are Community Wiki, so people are actually gaining rep for asking and answering the most mundane and subjective questions imaginable. I think this list very dramatically illustrates the problem with allowing these questions.  There's no end to them.  What's the best compass app?  What's the best flashlight app?  What's the best ukelele simulation app?  Gah! Is this what we're going to be, just a glorified review site?  Is it really that hard to just go to the market and read the reviews?  The Android developers have already built us this beautiful rating and review system that you can access right on your phone.  We don't need this fluff. Please, please, let's start closing these questions.  At the very least close them until we have moderators who can properly wikify them, but even then, I don't want to see people's 1-line recommendations taking up 20% of the site.  This is turning into a land grab with everybody wanting to own one of the big bad 500+ upvoted poll questions.  If we don't nip this in the bud, it's going to bite us hard later on. P.S. I'm not saying every question about an app is bad.  Here are two that are fine: In the first example, somebody is looking for a very specific app and has provided criteria to significantly narrow down the list of candidates.  In the second example, the author is asking for a comparison of two specific apps.  I see no problem with either of these. I just don't want to see two hundred ""Post your favourite [X] app"" polls by the time we hit public beta."
