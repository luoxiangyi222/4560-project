641,"My first thought was that the name Galaxy S actually refers to a series of 9+ devices, but we should probably make the synonym you suggest and create samsung-galaxy-s-series is there's a need for it. I've merged and synonymized the tags."
778,"It looked like service was actually mostly used to refer to network issues, i.e., problems with ""phone service"".  I replaced it with connectivity in most places, services where applicable.  I think it's probably best to let service die out rather than merge with something else.  If it comes up again we should probably rename it to phone-service or something clearer."
228,"Here was an interesting little experiment: Is there a Word Lens alternative/port for Android? I knew that ""Word Lens"" was a hot topic yesterday, and that question it turned out to be the most viewed post yesterday.  In fact it's gotten 219 views in the last 20 hrs where as the next most recent post to get 200 views was asked on the 8th, taking a week and a half to get to 282 views.  Of the most popular search terms that brought people here over the last day ""word lens android"" got 90 and the next most popular was Samsung i5500 2.2 with 6 visits.   Now as far as questions, this wasn't the best one on the site, and it probably wasn't very useful to building membership because people probably came here found that there is no such app and left.   The value of the experiment is that it goes to show how being mindful of whats trending and making good titles with good keywords is helpful in getting people here.  Now ideally if we are to seed questions based on hot topics they'd actually be useful (Like Al's ""When will my phone get Android 2.x?"" questions) so when they get here they find some value and stay.  "
565,"Gaming has gotten great traffic via asking users who get a new game to post as many questions as they can.  This provides the benefits of seeding (more questions) without the drawbacks (crappy, contrived questions) since the questions are intended to be about actual problems the gamers encounter.  It's simply prompting them to ask the question on Gaming rather than trying to solve the problem on their own.  Having so many questions about the game on the day of release and thereafter means that Gaming gets a huge chunk of the search traffic for the game. We could try a similar thing when Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) is released.  Everyone with a flagship device could upgrade immediately and start asking questions, as could anyone who gets a new device with the OS.  Probably it won't work as well as on Gaming, but it's sure to be better than nothing."
1312,"From looking on MSO it appears that when featured expires (after a week) the tag is removed from the cached render of the post but a new revision is not created.  So when you try to edit and add it, you're actually doing nothing, hence no change to the post.  To get around this you have to change the tags, as Bryan mentioned. Still a bug."
1828,"If you meant by this,  It actually shows the last activity on that post, excluding the deletion. Most possibly, here is the actual timeline: Hence, it shows Darshak Parikh's answer as the last activity."
923,"I went ahead and renamed stock-ui to vanilla-ui. I've also updated the tag wiki and the handful of questions that were using the old tag to use the correct terminology. There did not appear to be any questions that were using stock-ui to actually refer to a ""stock"" (manufacturer default) interface, so the tag is unused at this point."
1235,"I believe that these are actually different things: wifi-hotspotcould represent any wifi network, or a public 'wifi hotspot'. wifi-tethering would mainly represent the actual process of tethering, or creating a hotspot. As such, I don't think they should be merged."
633,"I'm getting one and hope to be asking questions here.  Bryan and GAThrawn have explained why. A minor note: Until it's actually released, I expect we won't be accepting questions about it &mdash; the only ones we could answer with certitude pertain to the information Amazon has publicly released.  Just like with Ice Cream Sandwich, we won't speculate or post answers that say ""go look at this thing Eric Schmidt / Jeff Bezos said""; premature questions generally get closed. Just something to keep in mind before you migrate :)"
557,"We shouldcan only create tags when there are posts to put them against. For one thing, no one may actually ask a question about that device. For another, the Stack Exchange software removes tags that don't have any questions associated with them after some number of days. (Four, I think.) So even if we didcould set up tags ahead of time it's likely they'd get deleted before someone used them."
