2089,"I too think it is pretty much off-topic. Example 1: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one should I buy? We simply can't know the expectations and parameters of choice of any person. Example 2: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one is
better? Since utility of a good is not quantifiable, the answers are going to be pretty much subjective and opinion-based. Example 3: I want a phone with following specs: blablabla Can you guys suggest any? There are websites that find phones with the desired specs already."
166,"It's pretty safe to say that shopping recommendations are off topic on virtually any Stack Exchange site (unless someone builds an explicit ""shopping recommendation"" site, of course).  It's even listed as off-topic in your original charter&hellip; twice: Where is the best/cheapest place to buy a HTC Desire?
   great on-topic example: 0
  great off-topic example: 21 With which provider should I buy my HTC Desire, to have the best price?

47,"The pertinent question, of course, is how much the additional criteria narrow it down. For example, if you ask for a browser app with bookmarks, that's pretty lame - they all have that.  Your example of a books app with barcode scanning and GoodReads integration is much better because it narrows it down to probably less than 5 or so apps. Of course, the voting is still pretty meaningless, but at least it's not an open invitation for everybody to post their favourite app. So for the most part, yes, I would say that the question format is valid, although individual questions would still have to be evaluated individually with respect to how meaningful the constraints are."
629,"It's always a good idea to put an extract or a summary with a link. If the link is dead someday, that can help track down the new location (if it exists) and/or give a guide to solving the problem in the absence of the original site. Link-only answers should always be discouraged, as that would just make this an extension of google (or an old-fashioned curated yahoo)."
622,"Frankly, I think questions like this should be closed as ""too localized"", but I'm afraid we're going to keep getting them. They're way too localized. Even a question like ""what's new in Android 4.0?"" would be marginal (I'd point them to Wikipedia, I look up what's new in each Google Chrome release on Wikipedia for example). An 2.3.x release on a specific phone model (I'm assuming vendors tweak each release?) is incredibly localized and trivial."
1091,"Besides many other features the moderator tools focus heavily on deletion/undeletion management. One action you can take is to review the closed questions for possible deletion candidates. But make sure that you don't vote to delete a question that is closed as duplicate. Furthermore, use your common sense if a question should really be deleted: Does  it, although it is closed, may provide valuable information? Finally, don't waste your delete vote on questions with a negative score, that is not locked and has no answers. It will get deleted after 30 days automatically by the system. Use the magic of search queries to find possible deletion candidates: Once in a while we change our policy about what is considered off-topic. For example how we handle questions about rooting. Which means that we have to reopen some questions that where considered off topic/not constructive/etc before. The mod tools provide an easy way to see were votes accumulate. Use that and cast your vote accordingly. This helps to keep our site clean. Though you might not be able to directly close/delete/migrate stuff, adding your flag moves the item up in the queue and helps moderators to quickly recognize the ""important ones"" (see also Dealing with obvious spam). Is actually a pretty nifty feature. Overrated posts which got a lot of negative feedback  could be a possible problem that needs to be fixed. On the other hand underrated posts may deserve a little upvote love from you. Most other functionality is already covered in the new review system."
1204," Liam W answered:  Tricky question. I believe that the biggest hurdle would be the fact that we are growing at a quick rate, and that the site may not be able to cope (due to lack of users). I would attempt to gather more users, and ensure everyone gets their share of the site.  dymutaos asked:  I'm not sure I understand. If we are 'growing at a quick rate', doesn't that mean we are getting new users?  Liam W responded:  Correct, however not all answer - most ask one question, the vanish forever.  Flow answered:  Something has happened in the last month or so. We had an increase in traffic/questions. But I have the feeling the questions are mostly low quality from drive by users that seek for help. While there is nothing wrong with asking questions, the quality of the question increases the chances for a good answer. I think we need a shorter version of ""How to Ask Questions the Smart Way"", that, for example is displayed to every new user that tries to ask a question here.  Flow continued: For example this section is a good best practise for every SX site."
1182,"Bad Example: URGENT HELP NEEDED - Galaxy S Problem! Good Example:  Samsung Galaxy S keeps restarting itself randomly. How can I stop this? Every non-native speaker is welcomed to ask questions (and provide answers) on Android Enthusiasts, but we expect a minimum of readability. Errors are human, nevertheless please try your best to write in grammatical, correctly-spelled English. What have you already tried to solve the issue?  Providing those can help avoid answers/comments with suggestions that you have already tried unsuccessfully. Don't try to emphasize a word by writing it in Caps (e.g. ""IMPORTANT""), use bold tags (""important"") or italics (""important"") instead. Don't ask about your attempted solution, instead ask about your actual problem. That is: if you are trying to solve problem X, make sure to ask about X and not about potential solution Y. The daily question limit is high, so please use separate questions for separate issues.  Asking about more than one question in your post will only cause confusion. A picture is worth a thousand words, but try to keep pictures in a reasonable size; huge pictures make it hard to catch the whole idea. It's hard to read a wall of text (example). Make use of Enter once in a while. 1 Although not strictly required, it's often a good idea to phrase the title as complete sentence."
1588,"My opinion is that questions which are purely about gameplay (""How do I beat level 5 in Inexplicably Popular Social Game-of-the-Month?"") should go to Arqade. They simply aren't about Android the OS, even if the title is platform exclusive. Configuring hardware or something to work with a game could be OS dependent - something like ""How can I set up a Bluetooth controller for my Android device?"" as an example - and those seem okay, but gameplay questions should be directed to...well, gamers. We may have gamers here, but it's just not our purpose."
1207," Flow answered:  I own 3 Android Devices. A Galaxy S running CM10, and Thinkpad Tablet running stock Android and a Kindle Fire running CM10. I use mostly the SGS and the Thinkpad Tablet. The Fire lies around the living room.  Liam W answered:  I own 2 Android devices. My SGS2, and my Arnova GBook. I use my SGS2 all the time, and my GBook (which isn't that good), to listen to spotify offline at night ;)  Liam W continued: My SGS2 runs CM10, whereas I just managed to root my GBook with difficulty.  Suraj Bajaj answered:  I am poor guy I tell ya! :( I own one (keep changing between CM 9 and 10, and other experimental ROMs) but I use bunch of them. :) You will find most of my friends' and family members' devices lying around me. I keep playing with them and also use them for testing my apps and experimenting some new stuff. :)"
