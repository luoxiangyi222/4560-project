1180,"As The Andro Nerd said, you have the option of just making your 1st Choice selection and the others will be ignored. Just note that in this voting system, if your candidate ""doesn't make the cut"", you will have no voice at all in what other candidates will be chosen. If you have already cast your votes, you can change them back to ""no vote"" by changing your choice then changing it back. Since you can have only one of each choice, if you select someone with the same choice it will remove it from the other person. Here, this should illustrate: Suppose you start out like this: You really just want to vote for Person A. You can do that with a couple of steps. Just change your vote(s)."
2038,"If the changes to be made are so minor that you can't find anything else to change, then just move on. In my experience, there is rarely a post that needs edits where there is not more than six characters to fix. Even so, there are plenty of other posts that are in serious need of editing. Once you get to 2000 reputation you won't have to worry about it."
634,"The answer is simple: Because it is more convenient to just post a link instead of a comprehensive answer. But, as this questions demonstrates, users like it when it's more convenient for them. GAThrawn and I have posted the same answer (I think we even googled the same page :-)), but mine was more rewarded by the community. I think mostly because my answer already contained everything that's needed, whereas the answer from GAThrawn contains a short answer and a link.
So it was beneficial for me to include as many information as possible in my answer, including the source.  I think that this be pointed out for new users/when posting answers: A link as a first answer is a good start, but if the answer contains nearly everything that's needed, the chanches for upvoting are way higher (reputation $$$)."
681,"Good question. While the changes are not neglectable, most changes are in fact development related. But this was also the situation with older version updates, where AN.SX still keeps distinguishable tags. I am not completely decided, but I tend to vote for keeping the honeycomb tags separated."
666,"Not sure about smartphones. But there is also tablet, so maybe it makes sense to keep the smartphone tag also. I am in favor of blacklisting mobile-phones and cellphones. Matthew is right: If the phone functionality in question is calling, calls is the tag to go. And for everything else, mobile-phones and cellphones is to broad and inaccurate."
1157,"I have nominated myself, so I think I should provide an answer. I believe that a Diamond Moderator should be active, as well as there. They would need to respond quickly to flags - so they can be dealt with. They would also need to have a good rep - so that people can see that they are trustworthy, as well as having been a member for a good while. I believe that a diamond moderator should always shed some light on their decisions - I know this is hardly possible, but I believe that they should comment, and help new members follow the site rules, and stay on topic. I know this has been quick - but this is what I believe."
1559,"Your initial post was way to offensive. I am considering to delete it all together and taking additional measures, but first I want say a few words. There is absolutely no need to insult anyone. A user voted on some of your questions, so what? Nothing happened, and even if something had happened: Everything within the Stackexchange network can be reverted. Users need to read the questions and answers before they comment. This
  kind of closing of questions and answers just discourages involvement.
  The onus can't be on the submitter to explain why his stuff is
  different when the judge, jury, and executioner was simply too lazy to
  read. Why is it a problem to explain why you think your questions aren't duplicates, if somebody else doesn't think so? What's wrong with a discussion to find a consensus? Besides, nothing has happened, there was no 'executioner' involved."
305,"Sure, I think that's a good idea -- I've gone ahead and wiki-ed those posts. There are also some fairly major changes coming to allow more editing by low rep and anon users, but the community wiki designator will always make editing easier."
2099,"Answers don't determine whether questions are duplicates. If an answer needs updating or another needs to be posted you should do one or all of: However, I'm pretty sure you're not correct about all of those changes since 5.0, since I was able to find and add methods that definitely work on some 5.1 and 6.0 devices.  Try it out. You should also look at my second answer.  This is not supposed to be possible for you to bypass, especially not with a locked bootloader.  That's the entire point of the feature."
2063,"I don't think it's necessarily off-topic, but you're less likely to get a good answer here than there IMO.  It really should be a bug report.  The portion  asking whether anyone else has the issue would be off-topic (polling), but presumably you care about the solution more than the prevalence.  Asking where to find it would also be off-topic."
