581,"I guess I fall into the ""middle class"" type of user (at the moment). I like to think I'm being generally helpful and contributing, but there's definitely a large, empty gap in the middle rep ranges which I've wondered about for a while. I'm going to go ahead and throw out a couple of things I've personally observed which have a negative impact on the number of available answerable questions. I don't claim any kind of statistical backing to any of this, mind you: That said, I also think that it's somewhat hard to attract real power users to a Q&amp;A site like this. Now I'm not saying we can't or that we should give up because I really enjoy having Android Enthusiasts around, but the nature of the beast is that much of what happens on e.g. XDA is very discussion based. There's a lot of trial and error, people experimenting with things and almost bricking their phones then collaborating on solutions, and developers putting out bleeding-edge stuff for others to test and give feedback on. We just can't cater to that here, and I think it does affect our userbase to some extent. Is it necessarily a bad thing? No, I don't think so. I'm personally glad to be able to come here when I have a question so that I can ask it without it getting lost in a sea of discussion and just get answers. I do think that it's a little bit of a handicap, though. That turned out to be a bit more lengthy than I intended, but that's my $0.02."
178,"I have two concerns. One, ""intrusive"" is very subjective. What's intrusive for you may not be a big deal for someone else. Second, and more important, is that I think it's too ambitious and doesn't fit in with this site. The number of tablets is going to grow exponentially and, unless someone is really dedicated, your proposed wiki will never be able to keep up. Once it gets out of date by more than a couple months, it will have lost most of its utility. Plus it has the potential to get really huge. This is the sort of thing that Wikipedia does well. Let them. "
2043,"All Stack Exchange sites are manned by the same company, and are run by essentially the same engine, with some additional per-site customizations like MathJax, etc. The new navigation is coming to all of them; this isn't really a subject for discussion. New interface is being tested on SO first, since the guiding principle of the company is to figure out what developers need, and then provide that thing to others. "
1066,"I am undecided. This are two different things, although there are  very few  questions. I would let them separated for a while and see how things go."
860,This if fine by me. Martin covers all the points I was going to say. Pass on over the good questions. :)
1120,"Your question says: There is already a similar question to this one, but mine is narrower in scope Yours is much more detailed, but I don't see how it's narrower in scope.  Your question says: Can I prevent such an app from running in the background? The other question says: Is there a way to prevent the service apps (or any other apps) from automatically running in the background? I don't see a difference.  You said ""That question was about saving memory"" but the question doesn't say that.  Regarding Jeff's comment on the other Meta question, I think there does need to be some form of distinction between the questions, not just between the ""desired answer"" and the ones given so far. You may take issue with the answers to the other questions (which are the same answers that yours was given), as have several of those who have asked them.  That's unfortunate, but it doesn't change the nature of the questions.  One option you would have is to put a bounty on one of them explaining that you want a solution for, and only for, preventing particular apps from running in the background. The reason why I want to do this is irrelevant. Perhaps it's to save battery. Perhaps it's another reason. This question is about how, not why. Questions like that are often received poorly; they're known as XY problems.  As a general rule, SE is about finding solutions to problems, rather than helping people with solutions they've already decided on.  That doesn't make your question off-topic or anything, but problem solvers tend to get annoyed in these cases. In the end, I believe the most basic answer to your question is ""rewrite the Android OS so it doesn't do that"" or something similar.  Given that, perhaps you can see why people want to give you alternatives. Going forward, I think it would be best to combine all of these question into one, as Flow said, with a single CW answer that address (1) why it may not be necessary/Android's design (2) the use of task killers and their drawbacks (3) solutions that actually prevent apps from running in the first place.  If that sounds agreeable I will create it once things are a bit more settled. Edit: I've created the question How can I stop applications and services from running? and closed all others as a duplicate of it.  Please feel free to add to, update, and correct it."
2230,"End-user hardware questions specific to an Android device are absolutely on topic. The first question you linked might be considered off-topic, since (as you said) it's not specific to Android devices.  However, we tend to give some leeway when the OP might not necessarily know that and is asking as if it were about Android.  The second question, though, is about a specific Android device and absolutely fine in that respect. (We have debated whether ""Does Device X have feature Y?"" questions should be allowed here, but that's a separate concern.)"
763," Matthew Read answered: The main difference for me would be doing things vs creating work for the mods.  As a regular user I'd flag things; as a mod I'd just delete/close/etc.  As a regular user I'd post minor tag problems needing merging etc. to Meta; as a mod I just do what needs to be done.  In both roles you always take the major things to Meta regardless of your ability to deal with it.  Al Everett answered: I want to help a good core of high-reputation users basically self-manage the site. If everything is going well, then a moderator's job truly is to be an exception-handler, taking care of those few things that come up that a non-moderator just can't do. We have some really good users now, but we need some more.  eldarerathis answered: Honestly, I just kind of want to cut out the middle man. I find myself running into clearly off-topic questions or non-answers, constantly refreshing the review queue and such but...all I can do is flag (or edit)! I spend a lot of time ""moderating"" as it is, so I figured - why not volunteer to actually moderate? If I can use that time to be helpful in other ways, too, then all the better. I just legitimately enjoy maintaining the site and helping the community.  Bryan Denny answered: If I wasn't a mod, then I wouldn't be fixing the things myself. I'd just be flagging them for the current mods to do those things.  Skip an extra step :) But the only difference between the two is the mod has slightly stronger powers which should hopefully not have to be used  Flow answered: Moderation of the site. Asking for feedback on meta about suggestions and ideas that I think improve the overall site experience. But the last point is something that every user is able and encouraged to do, regardless of the mod status and reputation!"
1049,"I don't know, whereas screen and display were really just different ways of saying the same thing,and were proper synonyms. These all seem like specific cases where a specific aspect or behaviour is being asked about. I think people are likely to search for ""screen timeout"" or ""screen brightness"" so these are useful tags. Though as the one question in Screensaver makes clear, that whole idea just doesn't make sense in Android at the moment, so it's debatable whether we need that tag at all. But if things like Android x86 take off and we start seeing Android in more devices like desktop-style machines, or when Android is running devices with expensive screens that are permanently connected to the mains power, like TVs, set top boxes and Ouyas then screensavers could become a real thing for Android in the future."
2363,"This site isn't a forum. There aren't ""follow-ups"" here: there are questions and answers. If you want to ask a question, use the Ask question button. If you know the answer to a question, write it in Your answer under that question. It doesn't matter how relevant it is: if it's not an answer to the question, it doesn't belong there. People who know the answer to your question won't see it if it's not posted as a question, and they can't help you, because you can't answer an answer. Running the site in this format is what makes it a repository of information that's easy to find and navigate, without the problems of thread hijacking and ""me too"" posts that you get on a forum. It means that people who know about the thing you're asking about will see your question on the front page of the site: you're not relying on them looking on the n-th page of a thread about a related question that they're not going to look at because they already know the answer. The tour is a really brief introduction to all of this. You get a badge for reading it, but more importantly, you also learn how to get your questions answered by experts."
