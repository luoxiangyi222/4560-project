399,"My part in that conversation started because travis said that his phone had the same problem as the OP's, so at first I was trying to find a common thread between their two devices. If they were both running ROMs running Sense UI that would suggest that perhaps it wasn't necessarily a hardware-specific issue and those of us trying to help should focus more on their particular firmwares and not just the phones themselves.  When travis said he didn't know I wanted to try to be clear when explaining to him what he needed to know in order to give me a useful answer. I hope that clarifies my seemingly off-topic comments.  :)"
393,"I think for that particular question it's okay. The issue doesn't appear to be device specific, so the steps JonnyP is suggesting should help both people. If Travis had opened a new question, we almost certainly would have closed it as a duplicate of this question. That's not to say that it's okay to hijack someone else's question, but that in this case I don't think it's out-of-bounds."
1084,I'd like to ask for opinions about the following idea: ATM is not possible to see if a question that is taged application was already reviewed. Therefore my motivation to review the application tag is very low. I suggest we retag every question that has been reviewed either with a more approbiate application tag or rename application to android-application. If the application count is zero android-application can become application again.
1615,"The first thing to understand was that this Stack Exchange site graduated from beta to a full site two and a half years ago. The design was set up at that time, and at that time Android v3.x aka Honeycomb was the newest version of the Android OS. You can see the thoughts from Jin, Stack Exchange's designer in this post: Design ideas for Android.se Site. (follow-up design talks: Design mockups for final site theme, New Design Launched &amp; Roboto is the new Droid. The honeycomb-ed background is obviously based on the idea of Android Honeycomb, and in my opinion is nicely understated, just adding a bit of texture to the page. It's also  physically isolated from the input boxes, which are either surrounded by white or black, so I'm not sure what the relevance of being nearly the same colour as the border of the input box has? You could certainly make an argument that Honeycomb is a fairly old version of Android now, but at the same time re-designing the site every time a new version of Android releases is probably a bit more work than Stack Exchange have time for while they're still busy launching new sites every month, all with their own unique designs. The ""green-ish question title and other texts"" points exactly to Android, for the reason that you yourself mention, that green colour is #A4C639. this Meta site is not using Android's bot logo properly If you have a look around the Stack Exchange network, ""meta"" sites always use a desaturated/greyed-out/monochrome version of the main site's theme. The site/Android logo on the main Android.SE site is based on #A4C639, the logo for the meta site is just  a grey version of the same logo. Android's branding guidelines allow for this sort of modification, monochrome-ing a logo is very different from making it pink with yellow polka-dots. that said, do you have any specific suggestions for how these things could be improved?"
1301,"All I can see this doing is having people not use the tags they're not allowed to use. Heck, most programming questions get tagged with applications (which has its own sort of issues), not development."
1881,"As we already do with rooting questions, we will permit ""one question per permission"", and link to it from What do android application permissions mean? This way we have a double profit: When we've consensus here, I would point that out in the permissions tag wiki. We've already started linking specific answers to permissions in the past, as you can see when taking a look at What do android application permissions mean? So I've just run over all questions tagged permissions and completed that for what we already have."
1330,"Is it a good idea? Yes and no. StackExchange is application-neutral, so unlike support in your own forum, people may and will recommend to use another app instead of yours even if the question title contained your application specifically. Therefore, questions that refers to a specific application may be generalized so it may be answerable with other applications.  Are there metrics about when it makes sense to redirect user questions to Android Enthusiasts? Although the ""too localized"" criteria is sometimes applied quite inconsistently, it still applies that if a question is written in a way such that only the Original Poster can benefit from the question, then it is going to be closed. Questions in StackExchange have to satisfy the criteria of applicability to a more general audience. Also, we generally frown against questions that requires specific expertise in a specific application because we do not have the necessary expertise to answer the application. Redirecting user supports to this site would only work if you also redirect application-specific experts to this site. Finally, the QA format of StackExchange is not suitable for extended discussion. If a troubleshooting requires extended back and forth discussion, then this is not the right place to do so. If a question needs extended discussion, you are certainly welcome to do it on Google Groups and then write a self-answered question that summarizes the discussion (after tidying up the unrelated discussions). If these seems acceptable to you, I don't see any reason why you should not redirect users here for support questions."
1704,"Torrent would rather refer to the file (see Torrent file), and thus again would be confusing. Moreover, this is the context this word is most commonly used, IMHO (if one ""downloads a torrent"", he's not downloading a protocol). Checking Wikipedia on ""torrent"" doesn't mention ""torrent"" as protocol, only ""BitTorrent"" (a peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P) communications protocol). Conclusion: bittorrent clearly refers to the protocol, though an application by the same name does exist."
2018,"We wont, for multiple good reasons. First, software recommendations are off-topic on many SE sites – with the definitive exception of one being dedicated to this, namely Software Recommendations (see: Where to ask for app recommendations?). Second, take a look at What should our new off-topic close reasons be?: Questions seeking application recommendations are off-topic as they become obsolete quickly. Third, they very much tend to attract spam, link-only answers, and the like."
2179,"It sounds like you want web applications Topics: Web Applications Stack Exchange is for expert and advanced users of web applications. If your question generally covers … Using Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, Google, or any other website which behaves like an application"
