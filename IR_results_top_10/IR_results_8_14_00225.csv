443,"Despite what I just said, on Matthew Read's answer, I'd support merging ""Ubuntu"" and ""Linux"" -- if we aren't going to distinguish every single operating system by version (which sounds to me like crazy talk ... every Mac OS? Every Linux distro and release? Eeek.) there's no reason to break out Ubuntu from Linux."
860,This if fine by me. Martin covers all the points I was going to say. Pass on over the good questions. :)
2232,"I don't know if there is general SE guidance on this, but I would say yes &mdash; clear cut cases seem like a good place for flags.  This site is not at the point where moderators need to heavily triage flags, as yet.  That said, I also go fully through most queues regularly, so a flag is not strictly necessary."
14,"I'm going to say that this depends on how specific it is.  At the least, it should be community wiki.  If it isn't specific enough, then it should be closed."
1152,"Yes, why not. There's no reason why we shouldn't opt-in. If Android likes to be cool, why its Enthusiasts can't. Go for it without turning back..."
699,"In going back through the unanswered questions, the following twelve seemed to be more likely to garner a response or interest from average user types.  "
1329,I'd like to hear other opinions too but my stance is that it's ok. Especially since you are an (active) member of the site and sure going to watch the ankidroid tag.  I'd like to make it clear that it's was 100% correct to ask first. Android Enthusiasts should not become a support/discussion forum for the various Android Apps out there if they Apps have a dedicated forum or help site. The question that remains is: Does AE.SX become a second place for Ankidroid support or are you going to close/archive the Google Group?
1311,"What circumstances is a general all-round ""yes you can"" or ""no you can't"" going to be useful? Are you just going to spend days throwing random commands at your tablet in random ways, or is there something specific that you're trying to do? What are you likely to be doing that has a chance of bricking your device? A question like ""Is there a chance rooting my device using the FancyNamed Rooting Method could brick my device?"" is answerable, (and will probably already be answered on the support thread for which ever rooting method you use). Your question as it is at the moment is very broad, has a lot of unknowns, and isn't really answerable with any answer that will stay the test of time."
697,"I really like the idea, I think there are a lot!! Here there are some of them: Block all sounds going out through speaker when headphone connected How can I fix the WiFi button or prevent WiFi errors when turning it off and back on?"
1969,"I'd say the tag is fine, and for those few questions more diversification is not justified. A tag-wiki excerpt could mention the tag is for all devices of the ""Micromax Unite"" brand, while the wiki itself could go into more detail."
