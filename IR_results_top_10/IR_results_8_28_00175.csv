2089,"I too think it is pretty much off-topic. Example 1: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one should I buy? We simply can't know the expectations and parameters of choice of any person. Example 2: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one is
better? Since utility of a good is not quantifiable, the answers are going to be pretty much subjective and opinion-based. Example 3: I want a phone with following specs: blablabla Can you guys suggest any? There are websites that find phones with the desired specs already."
270,"I think we should.  We may not want to expand to Android dev questions and the like, but it would certainly be within the scope of the site to help Android Enthusiasts find resources when they want to get enthusiastic about modding/dev/etc."
1363,"I respect that you want help others with re-opening your question. However our FAQ states that ""shopping recommendations"" are off-topic on Android Enthusiasts.  In fact all type of recommendations do not fit your Q/A format. A better approach would be something like the already existing question ""Where can I find a comparison of Android devices?"". The answers of this question also provide an answer to your question and the question is within the rules of our FAQ. I personally can only recommend geekaphone: It allows the comparison of different smartphones including the Apple ones."
2187,"A duplicate answer is an answer that does not add any information not alerady in an older answer. Note that the above text is only an example, but you need to provide the link to the original answer, if you want quicker mod action and/or don't want mods to search for a possibly long time to find the original answer because they have to do other things too and you are uselessly delaying them with that. At the bottom of every answer, just above the comment section, there are at least these 3 buttons: ""share"", ""edit"" and ""flag"" (if this isn't there you couldn't flag in the first place.) Then, go to the duplicate answer and do step 5 (or 5.2, if you managed to keep the flag window open all that time). A duplicate answer is a duplicate, no matter when it is posted. It just needs to be posted at least 1 second later than the original one in order to be recognizable as a duplicate."
2543,"Multi-line comments aren't available, precisely to discourage the kind of comments you're trying to write. Comments on this site are only temporary. You can use them to ask the author of a post to clarify something, or to explain how they can improve their post. (This includes pointing out a completely wrong answer and explaining why it's wrong.) If someone has commented on your question and you need to add more information to the question, do this by editing the question. Being in the question itself makes it much easier for others to find the relevant information: it's available to search engines, and it keeps your question in proper order. Comments can be deleted at any time so it's important not to put any important information there. Nobody wants to have to scroll through a pageful of comments to find the one piece of information that's needed to solve a problem. That problem that forum sites have is part of the reason why Stack Overflow was created in the first place."
1674,"I'm partly opposing Dan's answer for the reasons I gave in my comment to it: I doubt there are many ""new users"" doing any research before they post their question. So keeping questions ""as examples how you should not ask"" is a waste, IMHO. I however see a reason to not delete questions which might act as pointers to others. That's best explained using an example:
One of our most frequently asked questions is the ""I forgot my pattern/password and now I'm locked out"" type, which are usually closed as duplicates to Can not unlock my Android device as have no internet connection?. Formerly, that question was phrased ""Can not unlock my tablet..."". When I find such a (new) question and want to VTC it: how to find this ""master question""? Looking for ""Can not unlock my tablet"" makes it hard to find. It however turns out on top of the search when I type in the exact phrasing.
My point? Given a user really does a search before asking, he's unlikely to know the exact phrasing. But with more and more duplicates kept as pointers, chances to have one of them turning up on top of the search results are increasing. Opening that one then leads to the ""final point of interest"". In short words:"
1298,"Sounds good to me, except for the case where a user wants to restore their phone to original stock. I feel that asking where to find the stock image is a good question, since stock won't change (while ROMs are constantly created/updated/abandoned)."
61,"Yes, I find QR links very useful, especially when there are no many barcode scanners around. However, There should be a standard for these ""Here is an App that will help"" posts, just so we aren't A) leaching images, B) not shutting out users who want to see the app without having to go to the market place. Below, I've listed the way I've been linking apps to answers, including how not to leach images (IMPORTANT) because we don't want to get in trouble, now do we? For QR images, I've been using the following method: 1) Find the app on (marketplace e.g. AppBrain) you want to share
 2) Find the QR Code button, and locate the QR code.
 3) Copy the URL of the QR code
 The URL is
 Which is basically  If you use the Image upload tool on the post answer, you can use the image URL to reupload the image to imgur.com
 That way, you get the right QR code, generated from a reliable source, and you don't steal bandwidth. 4) MAKE SURE YOU HREF LINK TO APPBRAIN AT THE SAME TIME
So annoying when you get a QR link, and no web reference to what it is (I'm not sure what other services use, I use AppBrain for a lot of my stuff, but if you know the marketplace URL, just go from step 3 and hardcode the charts.api link yourself) (Freehand circles)"
785,"I have added ""Roboto"" to the font stack for the site(both main and Meta). For now I'm not using it as a web font like I did with Droid Sans, since I'm not too clear on the re-distribution licensing.  Roboto should show up on handheld after the next production build. Meanwhile if you want to see it on your desktop, you can download the font manually. "
171,"I'm trying to add this to (regular, non-hosted) gmail. I haven't added a lot of widgets, and I'm stumped the gadget URL is  It shows up, but is empty  and the gadgets settings tells me I need to configure an ID (of course)... but I can't find a way to configure the ID.  Does this not work for gmail -- which otherwise accepts gadgets --, or can I configure it?"
