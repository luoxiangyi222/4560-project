985,"I do agree that a little improvement needs to be performed on some of the lightest grey's used. I mainly use Firefox 13.0.1 under Ubuntu 12.04, and with my recently acquired ASUS VE228 LED Monitor, I have some trouble recognizing some of the lightest grey colors currently being used. Using Firebug, I've analyzed and collected some information regarding tags or classes that apply a light grey as a background color for a visual representation: #F4F4F4 is hard to see .post-tag class currently using #F4F4F4 This class is used on on regular tags. e.g., hard-to-see #F3F3F3 is hard to see code tag currently using #F3F3F3  This tag is used on inline code, when we wrap something around a `. e.g., I'm inline highlighted code pre tag currently using #F3F3F3 This tag is used when we either press ctrl + k or use the toolbar button . e.g., #F6F6F6 is hard to see, with considerations .owner class currently using #F6F6F6 This class is used for the background of a users signature. Note:
Since the rectangle for a user signature has a respectable size, it's easier to notice the color difference between the white background and the signature background. #EEEEEE works very well blockquote tag currently using #EEEEEE This tag is used when we either press ctrl + q or use the toolbar button . e.g., I'm a quote block In order to properly understand if this was an issue of my newly acquired monitor, or a overall situation, I've performed some tests (opening and navigating the  page) using difference OS’s and monitors. Here's the conclusions: Windows XP Professional Version 2002 SP3 | ASUS VE228 LED Monitor Browsers used: Result obtained: equal results on all browsers My conclusion for the tests performed is that under optimal color calibration conditions, the light grey's used are hard to distinguish from the white background. It gets really hard when we're reading a paragraph with some inline code, because at first glance I can't spot it. The code-block fails only if we are reading a single line of code. When two or more lines are used, it is reasonable visible, just like the background color for the user signature. Windows 7 Home Edition SP1 | Toshiba Laptop - Satellite C660 (built-in monitor) Browsers used: Result obtained: equal results on all browsers My Toshiba doesn't have any color calibration applied, since I don't perform any graphical design with it. The sole purpose for this laptop is the test of work being developed, just like a client would see it, so, everything is by default across the system. Here, It appears to work well on all browsers on all colors tested. Naturally that the light grey is more like a blueish color than actually a tone from black-to-white. So I can't really rely on this as to a positive assessment, I'll consider it a false-positive. Every grey color currently used below the tone provided by #EEEEEE can't stand out if used on small areas. Some improvements are noted if used of considerably large areas. The #EEEEEE works well for calibrated an non calibrated working environments. Have the following colors updated to a slightly dark tone: This assessment was performed with a Linux tool called Agave. I've used the tool color piker and picked the colors from examples provided on this answer. Then, I've lowered the tone by one, and the result provided was far more visible then the one picked.  HTML color code is placed on the lower right side of the color rectangle Using Agave color picker on this image, I did get the correct code for each rectangle picked. There seems to be no distinction between the colors in use or proposed colors when placed side by side respectively. All three used colors side by side are visually equal. Same goes for the ones suggested. As a side note: one may consider using just one color to replace the three being used."
485,"You make a good point. I have updated the button styling a bit, both on the main site and on Meta. For the main site, I made the button text green, and for Meta they're much darker now.  The changes will be in the next deployment."
2609,"If you are having a problem in performing a task with an app, you can seek help on our main site. It is within the scope of our main site. Per What topics can I ask about here? in Help Center: If your question generally covers... then this is the right place to ask. Basically, what problem (with your Android device) are you trying to solve? (Emphasis mine)"
1695,Merged the first two. Not sure about system-partition and partition as the are not semantically equal. I'd like to hear a few more voices on that.
1144,"On all meta sites except for MSO, reputation is synced hourly between your main account and your meta account. Since this doesn't happen instantaneously, there is sometimes a discrepancy between the two rep values in between syncs. The other result of this is that votes on meta don't affect your rep. Badges are not shared between the two sites. You earn badges on meta by participating the same way you do on the main site. You can read more about this in this post on MSO as well as the What is reputation? section in the meta FAQ."
1978,"While Bryan Denny ♦ already cleared the mist here, I strictly recommend reading the question: Who are the diamond moderators, and what is their role?, and the very  helpful answers there including this one which says: Diamond moderators are human exception handlers. The main function of diamond moderators is to follow up on flagged posts but they also have some special abilities necessary to handle rare exceptional conditions: (Emphasis mine)  E.g. This comment on my question was initially posted as an answer by an unregistered user (having 1 reputation point), but was later added as a comment by a Mod. "
2539,"[Is] it that I botched my question so badly that it's been judged as completely irreparable? This is what happened:  Your question was originally posted on Android Enthusiasts Meta. Being off-topic to meta site, and assuming from the screenshot and the rest of the body of the post, I deemed it on-topic to the main site and migrated it there. This cross-site migration automatically results in the post getting closed as off-topic on the originating site, which is meta in this case. On the main site, I exchanged comments with you to seek clarification. Post that, I evaluated that your post is not on-topic to our main site as well. Therefore, I closed the post there too.  Now, whenever a migrated post is closed on the destination, it is deemed as rejected by the destination site, which is the main site in this case. A rejected post is automatically locked by the system, and only Moderators can unlock or edit a locked post.  I feel sorry that you had a hard time here, but I only acted in the best interests of this site. If you feel that the system should not lock the question on the destination site for reasons you have given in your post, I suggest you take up your case on the Meta Stack Exchange because the software that powers our site also powers most of the sites in the network. Any modification would have ramifications for a majority of the sites in the network. "

1512,"I think what happened here is that there was already a suggested edit pending on that post when you reviewed it. The timeline looks like (all UTC): During that window between 18:57 and 19:12, you would be unable to suggest an edit on that post since there is already one awaiting review. Thus, when you tried to make some corrections to the post in the review queue, it returned an error. Therefore, I'd say the main problem here is that the text of the error message is very poor. If it had said something more like: You may not currently suggest an edit to this post because one is already pending. ...then it would have more accurately captured the situation."
833,"In addition to the search filtering that Flow mentions, you can also set up ""favorite"" and ""ignored"" tags from the right sidebar on the main page. Ignored tags will be faded grey on the question lists and favorited ones will be highlighted. "
