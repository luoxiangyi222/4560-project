1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
1631,"If it is just a copy-paste from a single comment, I usually do that and make it a Community Wiki. I fully agree with you, we should not adorn ourselves with borrowed plumes :) I however skip the Community Wiki part if I combine an answer from multiple comments while adding some more details (or point out connections/background). In that context, I don't feel it unethical to win reputation, as I put some real effort in my post."
2405,"I think it's important to look past the words the questioner happened to use, to see what the intent of the questioner is, and I wish close-voters would put a little more thought into that. This isn't 3-2-1, and you shouldn't lose everything just because you happened to use the magic word ""app"" in your question. Recommendation questions are opinion-based. They ask for lists of answers, and they tend to get spam answers as a result. The answers are less useful than Google Play search results, because they go out of date quickly. This is why we don't like them on the site. Which is the best music player? or Is there a good third-party SMS app? These are simplified examples of bad questions. What kind of answer will they get? A million answers saying ""I like such-and-such app, it's the best"" with no justification. An answer with a one-off copy-paste of Izzy's app lists, which will slowly go out of date or need editors to keep updating it over time. I have a bunch of CSV files in Google Drive and I need to download them when they change and add the results up. Is there an app for that? or I play games on my tablet with my kid ""helping"" sitting on my knee. He often grabs the rim of the tablet and pokes the volume button and makes it really loud. I need the volume buttons turned off when I'm playing a game. Is there an app for that? This doesn't seem like a ""recommendation"" question to me. What kind of answer will it get? There still might be more than one. It might say, ""Use such-and-such app, it can do this out of the box,"" but more likely, it'll say ""You have to install Pushbullet or IFTTT to find out when the file changes, then use Tasker to schedule downloading them and open Excel for Android to load the CSV files,"" or ""You need a custom ROM for this. Lineage can do it."" The difference is, you can replace ""Is there an app?"" with ""How do I solve my problem?"" without really changing the meaning of the question. In the recommendation questions, you can't do that. I think that's the crucial difference. If I find a question like this second pair of examples in the close vote queue, I'll typically make that edit so that people don't close the question, but I don't think the edit should be needed. Just because someone thought an app is the most likely solution to their problem, that doesn't turn a good problem-solving question into a recommendation question. I think we should all apply that test in our head: can I replace ""is there an app?"" with ""is there a solution?"" without changing the meaning of the question."
697,"I really like the idea, I think there are a lot!! Here there are some of them: Block all sounds going out through speaker when headphone connected How can I fix the WiFi button or prevent WiFi errors when turning it off and back on?"
2214,"Actually, though the animation is done by an event listener (as Matthew pointed out), there's no userscript needed. You can easily fool the javascript part by setting the animation duration to 0s in CSS: That did it for me at least."
822,"I normally save the &lt; kbd > tags for actual hardware buttons (or at least buttons that are normally hardware even if they're sometimes soft) like Power, Menu, Home, Back, etc. For menu options and clicking on items on the screen I'd normally either bold them (or for long options like descriptions on tick boxes ""enclose them in quotes"". So for your example I'd say Settings -> About phone -> Android version Or Settings -> Display -> tick ""Auto-rotate screen"" Or giving a Xoom the ""three-fingered salute"" would be hold down Power + Volume Up at the same time."
475,"Sure. There are plenty of great topics for blog posts that can hopefully go far above and beyond being a mere reference answer for common questions If this gets traction, coordinate with rebecca@stackexchange.com and she can get a provisional blog set up."
2544,"Stack Exchange uses WebSocket on some pages (e.g. question lists, chat room) to push updates (e.g. new questions/modified posts, new chat messages) from their server to the client's browser. At the same time, SE also notifies the browser how many updates there are by setting the badge text. Browsers that support badge notification (e.g. Vivaldi, also pinned tabs on Chrome in the past) will show the number of updates on the tab if possible (Vivaldi), or otherwise show a static indicator (pinned tabs on Chrome in the past)."
61,"Yes, I find QR links very useful, especially when there are no many barcode scanners around. However, There should be a standard for these ""Here is an App that will help"" posts, just so we aren't A) leaching images, B) not shutting out users who want to see the app without having to go to the market place. Below, I've listed the way I've been linking apps to answers, including how not to leach images (IMPORTANT) because we don't want to get in trouble, now do we? For QR images, I've been using the following method: 1) Find the app on (marketplace e.g. AppBrain) you want to share
 2) Find the QR Code button, and locate the QR code.
 3) Copy the URL of the QR code
 The URL is
 Which is basically  If you use the Image upload tool on the post answer, you can use the image URL to reupload the image to imgur.com
 That way, you get the right QR code, generated from a reliable source, and you don't steal bandwidth. 4) MAKE SURE YOU HREF LINK TO APPBRAIN AT THE SAME TIME
So annoying when you get a QR link, and no web reference to what it is (I'm not sure what other services use, I use AppBrain for a lot of my stuff, but if you know the marketplace URL, just go from step 3 and hardcode the charts.api link yourself) (Freehand circles)"
1344,"No, the flag should be declined. The answer is salvageable by editing, there is no mod intervention needed. The user should have been simply downvoting the answer and leaving a comment like  We expect answers on Stack Exchange to be self-contained. At the very
  least, should that link no longer work this answer becomes useless. At
  the very least, please summarize the information to be found there
  (don't just copy-paste) and use the link as a source."
