1201," Liam W answered:  Both. I believe that I should check to make sure the flags are correct, but also make sure I view new questions and ensure they follow the FAQ and guidelines.  Flow answered:  Plain moderation is purely reactive. But that doesn't prevent anybody from acting on unflagged content. On the other site. before the new review queues I looked at every new question and nowadays I just look what's up on the review queue. It saves some time and with more and more questions per day, looking at every new question becomes nearly impossible. Although I flag/downvote/vc a question here and there.  Suraj Bajaj answered:  Both. You need to proactively dig around to see if anything's wrong. Also respond to the flags by other users."
1615,"The first thing to understand was that this Stack Exchange site graduated from beta to a full site two and a half years ago. The design was set up at that time, and at that time Android v3.x aka Honeycomb was the newest version of the Android OS. You can see the thoughts from Jin, Stack Exchange's designer in this post: Design ideas for Android.se Site. (follow-up design talks: Design mockups for final site theme, New Design Launched &amp; Roboto is the new Droid. The honeycomb-ed background is obviously based on the idea of Android Honeycomb, and in my opinion is nicely understated, just adding a bit of texture to the page. It's also  physically isolated from the input boxes, which are either surrounded by white or black, so I'm not sure what the relevance of being nearly the same colour as the border of the input box has? You could certainly make an argument that Honeycomb is a fairly old version of Android now, but at the same time re-designing the site every time a new version of Android releases is probably a bit more work than Stack Exchange have time for while they're still busy launching new sites every month, all with their own unique designs. The ""green-ish question title and other texts"" points exactly to Android, for the reason that you yourself mention, that green colour is #A4C639. this Meta site is not using Android's bot logo properly If you have a look around the Stack Exchange network, ""meta"" sites always use a desaturated/greyed-out/monochrome version of the main site's theme. The site/Android logo on the main Android.SE site is based on #A4C639, the logo for the meta site is just  a grey version of the same logo. Android's branding guidelines allow for this sort of modification, monochrome-ing a logo is very different from making it pink with yellow polka-dots. that said, do you have any specific suggestions for how these things could be improved?"
1688,"Newbies, as in people that are new to using Android, are welcome here. Newbie questions about using Android are welcome here (as long as they haven't been asked and answered already here). Programming questions of any kind, even newbie programming questions, are not welcome here."
1633,"Moderator elections are held when new moderators are needed. Matthew already stated that we are covered, so I don't expect an election this year."
62,"I would say [Android-2.2] or [2.2]. I have no idea what most of the code names refer to, and the phones specs I see online only give the version number, not the code name.  I use a phone with android 1.5 - I know it is 1.5, I don't know what variety of food I would refer to it by. And you could tell me in the comments, but I think most new-ish users would have no idea."
1193," Liam W answered:  I don't think there currently is anything about the way this site is run that I would change. I believe it is run fairly, and like all other SE sites - change is bad, after all.  Flow answered:  Hmm, every SX sites has some major issues if the site becomes big with a lot of questioners and only a few experienced people. I think the biggest problem right now on SO and maybe in the feature on AN.SX ist the quality of the questions. IMHO we need a better way to do some kind of QA .  Suraj Bajaj answered:  One thing I would want to change is requirement of 50 rep to add comments. It makes new users add comments as answers, which is ridiculous! I have seen a lot of posts like that on StackOverflow and a few on AE as well. And hence new users often gain too many down votes."
287,"I don't think we should consolidate.  As Matthew Read pointed out ""rooting techniques vary wildly across devices"" and to add to that, they often change.  What works today may not work tomorrow after an OTA.  Also, there are new devices being released every month.  Creating a community wiki one stop shop for questions like ""When will my device get Froyo?"" is fine because the answer for each device is 2 lines long.  The answer to just one ""How to I root my XXX?"" can be very lengthy on it's own.   Two years from now when I'm looking for info on how to root my Kenmore Washer/Dryer Combo that's running Android 8.1 I don't want to have to sort through the instructions on how to root a G1 or the hundreds of other devices that aren't relevant to me."
1750,"I don't think we should create a tag for each and every app around â€“ that's not the purpose of tags. IMHO for that new Opera browser, the more generic opera-mobile tag should be OK. You can still fine-tune with your question phrasing which variant you're using."
2186,"I can't answer for every moderator, and the closest thing I found to an official policy is this question on meta.SE, but I can tell you my perspective. In the case you describe, where a user has written a new answer that isn't the exact same text as an old one but has the same information, typically I'll leave a comment telling the new user that their answer doesn't add anything new, and hinting that it would be better to spend their time on unanswered questions. If there's any possibility the new answer might be useful as a complement to the old one (e.g. it explains things differently, some users might find the new answer clearer, it's updated for a newer version), then I'll leave the answer in place. If it adds nothing at all, I'll usually delete the new answer: not to punish the answerer, but just to keep the site tidy, and to reinforce the message that we're not interested in duplicate content. As a non-moderator, you can add such a comment yourself, but please make sure to keep it encouraging. The new user is probably used to a forum site where you have to repeat replies to show that you agree with them, instead of being able to upvote. They spent their time writing the duplicate answer because they wanted to help, so complaining at them can feel very negative even if it doesn't seem that way to you. Make sure to say that there's no need to write a new answer, rather than that it's ""wrong"". Tell them that answering unanswered questions is more helpful. Welcome them to the site and thank them for contributing. If that all sounds like a lot of work, there's no need for you to do anything. Having the duplicate answer doesn't really harm the site, it just makes it a little harder for the best answer to ""rise to the top"" with upvotes. If you want to add a custom flag to the answer to let the moderators know, feel free, but the outcome will probably depend on which moderator happens to look at the flag. :-) There's another case, which is when a user posts the same exact text as another answer, either by the same or a different user, on the same or a different question. Please always flag these. We'll typically delete the duplicate and tell the poster why, but sometimes the situation is more complex and requires more effort. Sometimes it's a mistake, and the duplicate should have been an edit; sometimes it's plagiarism; sometimes it's an honest attempt to help, but it lets us know that there were duplicate questions that should have been closed. The system does quite a good job of detecting them, but some duplicates slip through. Typically I'll always mark those flags as helpful, even if I end up taking no action."
455,"Sounds good to me, especially since it appears users aren't using messaging to refer to email or anything else but SMS. I have proposed the other two as synonyms for sms (link). On the other hand, instant-message is proposed as a synonym for messaging, which I disagree with since again, users have only used messaging for SMS."
