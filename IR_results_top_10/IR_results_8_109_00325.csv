1160,"The only flags that need to be responded to quickly are spam, threats, and those where people have included personally identifiable information. All others can wait until they're gotten too. A Diamond should also have a light touch. An awful lot of things that are flagged shouldn't be. A Diamond should be fair, firm, and consistent. A Diamond should have a sense of humor, not take themselves too seriously, and recognize when they're not mentally well-equipped to deal with a situation. A Diamond should be in constant contact with the other Diamonds. Not necessarily to ensure consensus on every decision (although consensus is important) but so that they all know what's going on and to provide support where needed. A Diamond should expect to answer fewer questions and to spend a little time on the site every day, several times a day."
2187,"A duplicate answer is an answer that does not add any information not alerady in an older answer. Note that the above text is only an example, but you need to provide the link to the original answer, if you want quicker mod action and/or don't want mods to search for a possibly long time to find the original answer because they have to do other things too and you are uselessly delaying them with that. At the bottom of every answer, just above the comment section, there are at least these 3 buttons: ""share"", ""edit"" and ""flag"" (if this isn't there you couldn't flag in the first place.) Then, go to the duplicate answer and do step 5 (or 5.2, if you managed to keep the flag window open all that time). A duplicate answer is a duplicate, no matter when it is posted. It just needs to be posted at least 1 second later than the original one in order to be recognizable as a duplicate."
1222,"Ok, now I have got over losing (I think), time for this. I just wanted to personally thank everyone that took part and voted, and also every one of the 16 people that chose me as their preferred candidate. If we ever have another election, then maybe I can win this time - maybe more people will vote for me. Congratulations to the two winners, Flow and onik - well done :) If I ever get caught up in my thoughts again, direct me to this post please - and thanks to Izzy for calming me down Yesterday on the chat :) You never know - maybe two moderators will drop out for some reason and I will get instated ;) Just let me say thanks to everyone involved - and congrats to the winners."
1311,"What circumstances is a general all-round ""yes you can"" or ""no you can't"" going to be useful? Are you just going to spend days throwing random commands at your tablet in random ways, or is there something specific that you're trying to do? What are you likely to be doing that has a chance of bricking your device? A question like ""Is there a chance rooting my device using the FancyNamed Rooting Method could brick my device?"" is answerable, (and will probably already be answered on the support thread for which ever rooting method you use). Your question as it is at the moment is very broad, has a lot of unknowns, and isn't really answerable with any answer that will stay the test of time."
1051,"It is a question with a definite, non-subjective answer (as long as you just say what has changed and how, and stay away from saying if it's an actual improvement or now). However it's also very localized in time. The answer is only ever going to be useful for someone with your make/model and firmware version. The number of people with that combination is going to shrink to none over time as people pick up and apply the update. I think that this is probably something that would need to be taken on a question by question basis, and probably only for very major updates (eg 2.3 -> 4), or updates that would affect a lot of devices in the same way (eg a TouchWiz or Sense UI update)."
61,"Yes, I find QR links very useful, especially when there are no many barcode scanners around. However, There should be a standard for these ""Here is an App that will help"" posts, just so we aren't A) leaching images, B) not shutting out users who want to see the app without having to go to the market place. Below, I've listed the way I've been linking apps to answers, including how not to leach images (IMPORTANT) because we don't want to get in trouble, now do we? For QR images, I've been using the following method: 1) Find the app on (marketplace e.g. AppBrain) you want to share
 2) Find the QR Code button, and locate the QR code.
 3) Copy the URL of the QR code
 The URL is
 Which is basically  If you use the Image upload tool on the post answer, you can use the image URL to reupload the image to imgur.com
 That way, you get the right QR code, generated from a reliable source, and you don't steal bandwidth. 4) MAKE SURE YOU HREF LINK TO APPBRAIN AT THE SAME TIME
So annoying when you get a QR link, and no web reference to what it is (I'm not sure what other services use, I use AppBrain for a lot of my stuff, but if you know the marketplace URL, just go from step 3 and hardcode the charts.api link yourself) (Freehand circles)"
2323,"What's the intent of OP? ...Changing the date and time in the phone can ""evade"" the version and trial and continue to use it Further, they want to know .... if it was possible to change the date of a single app even by changing the source code of 'App To my mind, there is no ambiguity around that Is it legal ? - we are not equipped to discuss Is it ethical ? To me clearly, NO Could OP have other valid reasons for asking , which might have triggered this question ? - possible,  but if not stated, let's not assume either ways but go by what's presented ( also note that there was no response to my first comment, stating that it is unethical ) Should we permit such questions (not withstanding the fact that a diligent search on Internet would reveal ways and means ) ?? Emphatic NO"

1963,"As already explained in the comment section, this is a case of serial voting. To summarize it on your case, Voting fraud is the systematic voting against correct voting rationales. Fraud most often happens with a single user continually voting (up or down) on many of your posts within a short period of time. This is not considered normal behavior and the system will not allow it. If mass voting continues to happen [...] from a single user, or looks just plain suspicious in general, moderators and/or developers may investigate the matter and disciplinary action may be taken against the users involved with the fraud. Most often when you get unexpectedly serial upvoted, believe it or not, it's just a user trying to give you extra reputation. They saw a post of yours that was extraordinarily helpful to them and they feel that going through your posts systematically and upvoting them is the appropriate way of granting you additional reputation (apparently they've forgotten about the bounty system). (Emphasis mine) The system should automatically detect and reverse it Every night around 03:00 UTC, a voting fraud detection script is run that looks for patterns such as these. It basically looks for users who have upvoted another user many times. The number is fairly low within a given amount of time (the exact mechanics are kept secret). When the system detects this pattern, all of the votes cast from that user to the user affected are reversed and it prints a &quot;voting corrected&quot; statement in the affected user's reputation history to indicate what has occurred. The value of the reversal could be anything, as it is the combined amount of all the votes being reversed (up and down, although most serial voting occurs in one direction). If you had reached the reputation cap, the value may show up as blank if none of the votes being reversed actually affected your reputation on that day. But in your case, it didn't. This behaviour occurred on: for a total of 310 rep. Interestingly, the system didn't detect it, but a mod nuked the account instead, resulting in &quot;User was removed&quot; instead of &quot;Voting corrected&quot;. As I'm not a mod, I don't know whose account was nuked and why, but generally, we don't suppose to know unless the mod himself want to share it."
2353,"Thanks for raising this issue. To simply answer this, I would like to attribute this to time availability. There is a fair number of users with reviewing privileges for first posts (500+ rep users â‰ˆ 430) and much less for other review queues. Some of these users of late have not been active on the site, to perform various duties as reviewing (myself included) due to time constraints, however occasionally find time to carry out the duties wherever possible. In conclusion there is a growing number of new users (which is good) but it's not necessary that reviewers are declining in number, only time constraints. I think other users can give more reasons why review queues are retaining lots of posts than before."
