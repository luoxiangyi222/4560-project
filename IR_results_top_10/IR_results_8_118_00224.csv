2355,"I had been an active reviewer of all queues including the First Posts, and I currently top the First Posts review stats at 5436 posts reviewed. In the past I always clear the queue (or use up the daily 20 limit), but starting last month I personally no longer visit the First Posts queue. 3 reasons:"
456,"Given Jeff's answer &amp; response to my comment, and the fact that I can't see that any of our tag wikis currently ""Provide basic guidance on when to use the tag"" (though they do define what the tag means), I'd suggest we start with this. The Device/OS tags are a great example - can we first define when it is appropriate/useful to apply these tags, add some guidance to the tag wikis and see if that makes any difference?"
1566,"Maybe de-synonym remote-desktop for Android-controlling-non-Android and use remote-access for controlling-Android-from-anything. Also, perhaps remote-control could be repurposed for questions regarding the IR emitters some devices (Samsung GS4 and Galaxy Mega, HTC One, LG Optimus G Pro, etc.) are starting to include."
294,"Well, on meta.stackoverflow they use faq-proposed. Seems reasonable to me. Especially since some people have already started using it: "
1301,"All I can see this doing is having people not use the tags they're not allowed to use. Heck, most programming questions get tagged with applications (which has its own sort of issues), not development."
2179,"It sounds like you want web applications Topics: Web Applications Stack Exchange is for expert and advanced users of web applications. If your question generally covers â€¦ Using Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, Google, or any other website which behaves like an application"
1422,recording should no longer be used; I've retagged the handful of questions that were using it with more specific variants to disambiguate it. It is not a synonym of anything at the moment since the more specific tags will appear in the tag autocomplete anyway.
535,"The first three questions kind of use it sensibly: Those are clearly questions about different versions of Android in a general sense. That said, I don't think the tag is useful, and it's certainly been abused.  It doesn't create a useful category; I don't think filtering for these questions would be a common behavior."
39,"I totally thought the same thing about the 'android-app' tag being redundant. We should choose which one is the ""authoritative"" tag and edit all the questions to use that one.  I vote we use ""applications"". (Is there a way to blacklist tags?)"
1311,"What circumstances is a general all-round ""yes you can"" or ""no you can't"" going to be useful? Are you just going to spend days throwing random commands at your tablet in random ways, or is there something specific that you're trying to do? What are you likely to be doing that has a chance of bricking your device? A question like ""Is there a chance rooting my device using the FancyNamed Rooting Method could brick my device?"" is answerable, (and will probably already be answered on the support thread for which ever rooting method you use). Your question as it is at the moment is very broad, has a lot of unknowns, and isn't really answerable with any answer that will stay the test of time."
