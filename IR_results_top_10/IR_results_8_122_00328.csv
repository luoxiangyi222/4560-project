1773,"Custom flags (those raised using the ""other"" reason) are intended for things that cannot ordinarily be handled by the community. These flags go directly to the moderators, whereas other flags will go into various review queues that can be acted upon by other users of the site. Someone saying ""thanks"" is simply not something that is generally going to require direct moderator intervention. It is not actively harmful to the site, and there are tools already available to you that are appropriate for the situation: Secondly, as Dan alludes to in his answer, if you do use the ""other"" flag reason, you need to be really, excruciatingly specific in your message. Your flag is basically telling us ""Hey, something is wrong, and I, as a regular user, am unable to handle it with the current tools. I need a moderator!"" Entering your flag description as ""saying thanks"" doesn't provide us with enough information to act on. In the context of this flag, you actually raised two separate flags on the same post, one minute apart from each other. The first is the flag you noted above. The second was a flag on one of the comments on the post. Moderators cannot respond to comment flags, so we had to respond to the post flag instead, which appeared to be connected in purpose to your comment flag based on the timestamp and the content of each flag."
2232,"I don't know if there is general SE guidance on this, but I would say yes &mdash; clear cut cases seem like a good place for flags.  This site is not at the point where moderators need to heavily triage flags, as yet.  That said, I also go fully through most queues regularly, so a flag is not strictly necessary."
1936,"The more appropriate close reason for the current and previous revision of the post might be ""primarily opinion based"". You could argue that one could collect statistics about which manufacturers upgrade the most often, and so on, but it's a rather complicated endeavor.  Within specific time periods and device lines you're going to find wildly different information, and none of it is useful going forward because there are simply no set-in-stone policies here.  We want questions to be useful to future readers without their answers needing to be revised all the time. Ultimately it still seems like a shopping advice question, or at least suffers from the same issues as those questions. I can't comment on the views of the other mods, but upon logging in today I found that all of them had viewed your post and declined to take action which is why I dismissed your flag."
830,"Just flag a post that it's on and use the ""other"" option to explain what's going on."
860,This if fine by me. Martin covers all the points I was going to say. Pass on over the good questions. :)
1770,"Click your avatar in the top bar to visit your profile page. If it says ""more info"" at the top, next to your username, click that. Where it says ""helpful flags"" and then a number, click on the number. On that page, you can see your flagging history, including the status/response of each flag (whether it's still awaiting review, or was judged to be helpful or unhelpful). Alternatively, you can just type in the URL but replacing ""12442"" with your user ID (the number that shows in all URLs about your profile)."
14,"I'm going to say that this depends on how specific it is.  At the least, it should be community wiki.  If it isn't specific enough, then it should be closed."
1171,"I have had 2 flags denied now, and I always wondered - is this a bad thing? Two flags is nothing.  As a percentage, you're also doing well. Should I be disheartened if my flag gets denied? Nope.  Just learn from it!  Or if you're convinced, try to explain your case (perhaps using the ""Other"" flag reason). Should I worry about wasting the time of a moderator, because it shouldn't have been flagged? No.  If you see something going wrong we absolutely want you to flag it, a few misses here and there are perfectly fine (especially if you're improving your flagging as you go). An exception is when people flag posts they just don't like, or instead of editing.  That's really annoying and not how flags should be used. I only flag posts for closure because I can't vote to close a post - should I not? Until you can VTC, flagging is the right way to do it. What deem's a 'helpful' flag? Most often, one that results in some kind of action.  If your flag is for the wrong reason but I think another reason still applies, I'll mark it helpful.  If an answer is nigh-unintelligible and you flagged as Not an Answer, but I happen to know what they're talking about and I edit instead, I'll mark the flag helpful. I won't mark the flag helpful in cases where someone flags NAA but it's just a spelling and grammar error-ridden post where the meaning is still clear.  That's the decline reason that says ""Flags should only be used where moderator intervention is required""; we aren't here to do editing on your behalf :) I will also occasionally mark flags helpful in cases where I do absolutely nothing except think hard about it.  When an issue is borderline and I just barely am on the ""nothing needs to be done"" side, I won't fault you for flagging it."
902,"Slow down, dude. I see over two dozen flags in the queue. By and large, the community should decide whether questions should stay or go. While we Moderators are part of the community, and part of our job (especially early on) is to help guide the community, the flag queue is really for those situations that the community can't do by itself. A lot of the stuff I'm seeing in the flag queue now are things that the community can deal with. There are plenty of people who can vote to close. We also have enough people to vote to delete. Certainly these questions deserve their downvotes. So please only flag things that need to be dealt with by a Moderator's super powers. It's not like the site is ""full"". A question that's on an obscure topic may still get an answer some day. If it doesn't, then it's lack of votes and views will move it to the bottom of the list."
1969,"I'd say the tag is fine, and for those few questions more diversification is not justified. A tag-wiki excerpt could mention the tag is for all devices of the ""Micromax Unite"" brand, while the wiki itself could go into more detail."
