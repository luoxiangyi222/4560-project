1223,"I agree with Al on file-folders and home-screen-folders. I also agree with not needing a separate tag for the mail folders (the email tag should be sufficient here). Number 4 (gallery) are in practice most likely filesystem folders (except when tags would be represented as folders). I don't think this would need a separate tag. But I'm a bit unsure where a possible synonym ""folders"" should point to. If the mentioned brain-washing would not have taken place, I'd happily agree on Al's suggestion here as well; but even being a MS-abstainer I must admit: on hearing the term ""folder"", my first association are directories, followed by email folders, and only after that the homescreen folders -- so I'm unsure about that. One good thing about that synonym would be to save us from a tag with the same name reappearing, though :)"
917,"The best you can really do currently is to create a new room and then invite the user to that room. You can also leave a link to the room as a comment on their post if you want. The automated chat link will also create a public room, so from that regard it's essentially the same (and you can give it whatever title you want). One downside is that the auto-inserted link will import the comments from the post into the chat room when it's created. Creating your own room beforehand will not do this, but if you are pre-emptively setting up a chat with someone then there is likely not going to be a long comment thread to import anyway, I'd imagine. This has also been discussed on Meta Stack Overflow."
1657,"I would keep the tablet tag. But I would also have kept the phone tag, as I think that there exist questions that are only relevant for phones and tablets. Please don't confuse this with irrelevant tags added to posts. If a question isn't phone specific, there is no need to add the phone tag. Side note: But there is also no big harm in adding it, as long as the tag doesn't occupy the spot for a more relevant one."
2099,"Answers don't determine whether questions are duplicates. If an answer needs updating or another needs to be posted you should do one or all of: However, I'm pretty sure you're not correct about all of those changes since 5.0, since I was able to find and add methods that definitely work on some 5.1 and 6.0 devices.  Try it out. You should also look at my second answer.  This is not supposed to be possible for you to bypass, especially not with a locked bootloader.  That's the entire point of the feature."
1585,"For the most part, we don't need device-specific tags. They lead to overuse. It's pretty rare for an issue that someone is facing to actually be specific to their device. (People should use tags to help categorize their issue, not their device.) I've not seen evidence that there's an overabundance of questions where the distinction between the original Nexus 7 and the newer (2013) model is in anyway important. So, I say: No, we don't need a new tag, nor to rename the old one."
2005,"IMHO we don't need a separate tag for that, as customization (which we already have) covers that perfectly. For ease of transition, we might consider creating personalization as synonym to this – which also had the pro guiding people looking for the right tag, but not as a separate tag. Our tags do not resemble categories in Google Playstore (one could also point at Google asking to create a ""custom-rom"", ""rooting"", or ""adblock"" category, referencing ASE having a tag for it – I bet no chances for #3 there :)"
1509,"Since we still had one empty slot and given the fact that I encountered a few of such questions in the last week, I added the following off-topic reason; Questions which are Android-independent, such as ""Does Carrier X have
  prepaid plans?"", are off-topic. Consider taking advantage of other
  resources
  that may be appropriate for your question. It still needs approval by another mod and is up for discussion."
319,"What you really need is somewhere with something more like a discussion forum, than this Q&amp;A site, also that place needs to already have an active community of developers hanging around and actively contributing. I don't think that this sort of thing is relevant here, but it is certainly something that another website could (or perhaps already does) do. I think you'd have trouble getting a new site up and running to do this, as it will be very easy to attract people with ideas ()perhaps even demands) for new apps, but quite hard to attract the necessary experienced and motivated developers. You'd need a site that already has a big enough community of devs with spare time on their hands to bootstrap your idea. Having said all that, there have been a couple of times lately when someone asked for an app that doesn't exist, and a member or two here have gone off and written one (this one springs to mind), but that is very rare simply because most people here are Android Users, rather than Android Developers. StackOverflow does have the developer community, but requests for new apps would definitely be off-topic there. XDA is one place that could do this, but currently doesn't - I think they do allow requests for new custom ROMS and changes to existing ones, particularly for models that haven't got one yet, but as they don't specialize in app development they may not be willing to expand in that direction."
474,"Per   Avoid generically defining the concept behind a tag, unless it is highly specialized. The “email” tag, for example, does not need to explain what email is. I think we can safely assume most internet users know what email is; there’s no value in a boilerplate explanation of email to anyone. Generally, you want to tailor the definitions to your community -- and also, critically, provide guidance on when to use the tag."
1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
