1597,"Scripts can have accounts too. It would be easy for a spammer or other malicious user to sign in and then give control to his script. Having the possibility of a CAPTCHA for signed-in users prevents this attack. The system has a few ways to guess whether particular activity is from a genuine user. Full details aren't available to us end-users, because that would make the system too easy for attackers to defeat. One common way to make the check go wrong is to leave a page open for a long time before submitting the form; for example, you start to answer a question, then get interrupted, go to lunch, come back an hour later, finish answering the question, and then get the CAPTCHA when you try to post your answer. This is because of a token in the page that expires after some time."
792,"I am very unlikely to root my device, so I don't really have any skin in this game. That said, I do believe the current canonical question is getting too big and unwieldy. I think ""How do I root device X"" or, even better, ""How do I root Y class of devices"" is a good way to go. I'm concerned, though, about the different ways one can root a device. I would caution against ANY ""how do I root device X with method Y"" questions. I also agree with Flow in that these shouldn't automatically go to Community Wiki. It will take work to put this information together; the people who do should get the reward. We also have a slew of closed questions that can be re-opened and answered. That should make the askers happy. (Although that's not a reason to do this.)"
1118,"Just because a question is Closed doesn't mean that it is locked away forever. Being Closed gives the original author (and others) an opportunity to improve the question and, hopefully, get it re-opened. If you believe that the questions are not essentially the same, then please edit your question to make that distinction. It would be a good idea to link to the other question and explain why yours isn't a duplicate. If the community agrees, those with enough Reputation points can vote to re-open. If that process seems slow, you can Flag the question for a Moderator and explain that you've edited the question to make it clear it's not a duplicate. Or, you could raise the issue here (as you've done) but without making the edits to distinguish the questions it might not go very far."
606,"I've thought about this some more, and I think we had a bit of a shift after the site went public.  Though I won't point them out, there were a few highly active users I can think of who largely disappeared after that. I'm not sure why that happened, but I do wonder if it's related to the rep requirements suddenly doubling.  I was about to hit 10k rep then (Trusted User) and it was a bit of a shock when I realized I was going to have to duplicate my entire performance so far just in order to get back where I was before, since now Trusted User is 20k rep. That must have been immensely discouraging for some users.  Maybe now we're just waiting for new users to come up and fill the middle tier that was suddenly vacated by the change in rep requirements? I'm not sure it makes sense to have the same rep requirements as a huge site like SO either.  I would happily trust GAThrawn or eldarerathis, for example, with the 10k tools.  Their work flagging and close-voting is immensely useful and they have great judgment.  We don't require mods to have 20k rep before making them mods, right?  I'm the only one over 20k and I just got there recently! Maybe we already have a middle class, and we're just not making effective use of them."
1599,"I propose that that line should instead read: Issues with Google Play (or any other app marketplace) from the point of view of a developer or publisher This way, we get to make it clear that issues with Amazon App Store etc. (from the POV of a developer) are also off-topic."
228,"Here was an interesting little experiment: Is there a Word Lens alternative/port for Android? I knew that ""Word Lens"" was a hot topic yesterday, and that question it turned out to be the most viewed post yesterday.  In fact it's gotten 219 views in the last 20 hrs where as the next most recent post to get 200 views was asked on the 8th, taking a week and a half to get to 282 views.  Of the most popular search terms that brought people here over the last day ""word lens android"" got 90 and the next most popular was Samsung i5500 2.2 with 6 visits.   Now as far as questions, this wasn't the best one on the site, and it probably wasn't very useful to building membership because people probably came here found that there is no such app and left.   The value of the experiment is that it goes to show how being mindful of whats trending and making good titles with good keywords is helpful in getting people here.  Now ideally if we are to seed questions based on hot topics they'd actually be useful (Like Al's ""When will my phone get Android 2.x?"" questions) so when they get here they find some value and stay.  "
186,"Don't post an answer that should be a comment. ""Me too"" answers will (eventually) get deleted and, as you've noticed, the community doesn't like them (hence the downvotes). To gain reputation: Ask good questions; make good answers. You're not the only one who is occasionally frustrated with the rep limits for activities on the beta sites. I've seen several such questions on  On the plus side, you'll get those reputation points back when your downvoted answer is deleted."
1329,I'd like to hear other opinions too but my stance is that it's ok. Especially since you are an (active) member of the site and sure going to watch the ankidroid tag.  I'd like to make it clear that it's was 100% correct to ask first. Android Enthusiasts should not become a support/discussion forum for the various Android Apps out there if they Apps have a dedicated forum or help site. The question that remains is: Does AE.SX become a second place for Ankidroid support or are you going to close/archive the Google Group?
608,"On the one hand I would prefer one site per answer so that we can vote
  on them individually and the good ones can rise to the top. This also
  makes sense since it's impossible to create a single definitive answer
  (some editors will find a particular site useful and others won't). Well, there are a few problems with these questions. Older answers will by default have more votes than newer answers, so for a question that's been open for months, you can't judge anything about the quality of a site/answer by the number of votes (unless they're into the negative, in which case it's a useless answer that misleads visitors who don't understand our voting and should probably be deleted). Once the answers overflow a page, though, you get into a situation
  where new answers never get seen or voted on, since few people go to
  the next page. I think the StackExchange team have tried to combat this effect over time. Unlike us, who've all been here long enough and clicked enough links to change all the defaults, new users coming to those pages will see a semi-random ordering of the answers (I think there's an activity bias to the randomness) so no two visitors should see the same ""first page"" of answers. I'd be tempted to say that if we keep these type of questions on the main site, then rather than treating them as a popularity contest between the answers, we do something more like the other ""community resource"" questions (like the ""when will my phone get updated"", ""how do I root"" type-stuff). So we make (almost) no obvious judgement on the quality of the sites and edit them all into one community wiki answer by category. (obviously the quality bar of each site will now be whether a user thinks they're good enough to nominate, after that all linked sites are treated equally)."
844,"I definitely agree that these are valid concerns. One of our biggest challenges is finding promotions that have an effect. It seems like we've found ways to generate a temporary spike in questions, but that doesn't necessarily translate into users that stick around. Our theory was that if you generate enough spikes, there will be the occasional user that sticks around. I don't think there has been enough time or enough contests to determine whether or not that is true, but I do think that promoting the site through a contest is a good thing, because it makes the site more visible. In other words, it's definitely good to look at how active people are after they enter a contest as one metric, but contests can also attract new users after the fact because of the new content. That being said, it is important to make sure our questions and answers remain high quality, and contests that promote asking bad questions are always bad. That's why we decided to go with views for Audio Week instead of a random drawing. We figured that votes were more easily inflated than views, and that better questions would be clicked on more. However, it might be worthwhile to place more emphasis on votes in the future. Perhaps holding questions to a standard of ""at least a score of 3"" (or 5, or something) would be a better. "
