1051,"It is a question with a definite, non-subjective answer (as long as you just say what has changed and how, and stay away from saying if it's an actual improvement or now). However it's also very localized in time. The answer is only ever going to be useful for someone with your make/model and firmware version. The number of people with that combination is going to shrink to none over time as people pick up and apply the update. I think that this is probably something that would need to be taken on a question by question basis, and probably only for very major updates (eg 2.3 -> 4), or updates that would affect a lot of devices in the same way (eg a TouchWiz or Sense UI update)."
841,"I think you're seeing one of two behaviours that changed recently with @replies. Essentially the @reply isn't auto-completed (and is often removed when you post) if there is only one possible, unmistakable person who's the target of your post and so your @name bit would be redundant. So if you're making a comment on a question that has no answers, and it's the very first comment, then you are obviously making a comment to the questioner, so adding @name is redundant. The other thing that's changed is that when SE thinks that two people are having a conversation (when there's only two of you commenting and you're going back and forth between you) then the @name is removed too, as it's obvious who you're talking to. In these cases even though there's no @name in your comment, because it's obvious who you're talking to the person that you're talking to will still get notified that you're talking to them (for instance question askers are always notified when someone comments on their question with @naming anyone else)."
2323,"What's the intent of OP? ...Changing the date and time in the phone can ""evade"" the version and trial and continue to use it Further, they want to know .... if it was possible to change the date of a single app even by changing the source code of 'App To my mind, there is no ambiguity around that Is it legal ? - we are not equipped to discuss Is it ethical ? To me clearly, NO Could OP have other valid reasons for asking , which might have triggered this question ? - possible,  but if not stated, let's not assume either ways but go by what's presented ( also note that there was no response to my first comment, stating that it is unethical ) Should we permit such questions (not withstanding the fact that a diligent search on Internet would reveal ways and means ) ?? Emphatic NO"
1936,"The more appropriate close reason for the current and previous revision of the post might be ""primarily opinion based"". You could argue that one could collect statistics about which manufacturers upgrade the most often, and so on, but it's a rather complicated endeavor.  Within specific time periods and device lines you're going to find wildly different information, and none of it is useful going forward because there are simply no set-in-stone policies here.  We want questions to be useful to future readers without their answers needing to be revised all the time. Ultimately it still seems like a shopping advice question, or at least suffers from the same issues as those questions. I can't comment on the views of the other mods, but upon logging in today I found that all of them had viewed your post and declined to take action which is why I dismissed your flag."
2322,"As long as it does not violate any existing law (tricking with date/time , AFAIK, does not violate any) in applicable countries, we should be welcome to discuss. As per my answer, such tools does exist. That trick does not involve any cracking or reverse engineering. It makes no difference (to that specific app) from changing the global time of my device. Then why global but not to only one app? What if the OP did not mention ""trial period"" at all? What if the OP wants to test an alarm app or Trigger's timed event? It's wrong to judge that ""because your intention is unethical, your goal/objective is also wrong"" (and closing the question). As said above, the answer may be useful to someone looking for a way to test an alarm app. I agree that such questions should be closed: How can I bypass the trial period? How can I get the full version for free? ... but not these: I know setting a fake time can bypass the trial. How can I set it? Placing this key file grants me the full version. How can I move this file to the desired place? I already have it in my SD card. Let me repeat: It's not hacking. It's unlike Freedom or Lucky Patcher. I agree that F/LP should be OT here for illegitimacy (referencing Stack Overflow's opinion)."
2327,"The point on the question from the headline is about changing the date/time in one app, not about piracy. The whole text is about piracy, and that is what makes the question a bad example for the real question here. In principle, you will often encounter questions with a technical and neutral question, which has one paragraph of motivation which is not ethical. Like when this question would be framed as Introduction: I have a trial version of an app and like to continue using it after the trial period. Question (about date/time settings): To do so, I would like to change date and time on the phone, but only for this app. Is there a way to do it without changing the source of the app? While other cases are more clear: how can I continue using a trial version after the trial period? Any hint welcome, I just do not want to change the time for every app on the phone to do so. Actual question: How do I evade the trial period? In the end, you should not forget, that a question about how to evade the trial period in this way even comes handy for the app author, which learns how users avoid his restriction in the app. The knowledge is there anyway and if it is not answered here, it will be answered elsewhere. But here it is visible for everybody, including the victim of the piracy. So it is kind of full disclosure (in computer security terms) to have an answer here, which can be used by the next author of a trial app to avoid making it too easy to keep using the app after the trial period. And then there is @liljoshu's point: Where do the ethics begin and where do they stop? Avoiding trial periods costs the author money, so it is not ethical. What about ad blocking? And finally, some app authors are making money by selling your data. Do you want to prevent people from asking how they can protect their data against apps, which sell your data? "
1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
356,"This is very similar to a shopping recommendation and much of the same advice applies.  Beyond that, consider: you have created an ""infinite list of X"" question. Surely there is (probably) an Android equivalent for every single iPhone app? the equivalents, even if valid now, may change over time; apps change over time. The value of this list will be highly limited as it ages. Perhaps if you had specific things you were looking for Android equivalents to on iPhone -- like the built in default applications. But scoping it to ""any app that can ever be, or will ever be"" just doesn't work."
1312,"From looking on MSO it appears that when featured expires (after a week) the tag is removed from the cached render of the post but a new revision is not created.  So when you try to edit and add it, you're actually doing nothing, hence no change to the post.  To get around this you have to change the tags, as Bryan mentioned. Still a bug."
