488,"I really like the design - very clean &amp; elegant. It does occasionally feel a little bit washed out / monochrome however. I'm sure there are specific elements that could be a bit darker or more colourful without changing the overall elegant feel. I think the most constructive thing to do would be to try and identify specific elements like this, as GAThrawn did here. A few more little accents and highlights like this and I'm sure it would all click together beautifully!"
155,"Al E.'s great idea just needs a little setting up for those that would miss the reference. Something like: ""Android Questions? These are the Answers you are looking for."" (No comments under 50 rep is a PITA! Sorry for the additional answer)"
773,"I was a little disappointed when I opened this and discovered that I will not be receiving free ice cream sandwiches all week, but this idea is neat, too. One suggestion: Could we enforce some kind of minimum question score in order to be eligible for any drawings? Entering everybody would allow people to post really bad questions like ""Why is ICS so AWESOME!"" just to get an entry. I'd be inclined to say that only questions with a score greater than zero should be eligible (so at least someone else thought it was a good question). (I also realize this would be a bit different than the Kindle Fire contest, where it appeared that people with zero score posts were entered into the drawing provided that no other answers on the question were upvoted)"
1992,"While I can follow Firelord's argumentation, it still seems rather a comment than an answer. As a comment, it would be very acceptable: ""It may be … Could you try …"". Then, with the OP having tried and approved, it would be a good answer: solving the issue as proven. Or it would stay a comment when not proven. My approach thus would have been: Flag NAA, leave a comment, convert to comment on the question. BUT: answerer included ""solve the issue as it did for me"", which in fact is kind of prove (empirical) – so it seems to be a valid answer. I agree however it could use a little re-phrasing to make that clear: In my case, this was an issue with Google Now. I was able to solve it this way: Guess you agree: put that way, you wouldn't complain :) EDIT: Sorry for being a bit unclear. I of course didn't mean to say one should always place a comment first :) So in short:"
581,"I guess I fall into the ""middle class"" type of user (at the moment). I like to think I'm being generally helpful and contributing, but there's definitely a large, empty gap in the middle rep ranges which I've wondered about for a while. I'm going to go ahead and throw out a couple of things I've personally observed which have a negative impact on the number of available answerable questions. I don't claim any kind of statistical backing to any of this, mind you: That said, I also think that it's somewhat hard to attract real power users to a Q&amp;A site like this. Now I'm not saying we can't or that we should give up because I really enjoy having Android Enthusiasts around, but the nature of the beast is that much of what happens on e.g. XDA is very discussion based. There's a lot of trial and error, people experimenting with things and almost bricking their phones then collaborating on solutions, and developers putting out bleeding-edge stuff for others to test and give feedback on. We just can't cater to that here, and I think it does affect our userbase to some extent. Is it necessarily a bad thing? No, I don't think so. I'm personally glad to be able to come here when I have a question so that I can ask it without it getting lost in a sea of discussion and just get answers. I do think that it's a little bit of a handicap, though. That turned out to be a bit more lengthy than I intended, but that's my $0.02."
1914,"I reopened the question.  I agree with you that it was just a bit unclear but does seem to be about using an old kernel with a new ROM, which is fully within our purview.  If the user wants to know how to create a custom ROM based on that it would be of-topic, but we give the benefit of the doubt. Do note that closure is intended to be a temporary state before either deletion or editing and reopening (which is why it now says ""on hold"").  Quick closure is generally a good thing since it decreases a post's visibility a bit, so it won't gather downvotes while it's being improved and doesn't gather answers focused on the wrong thing.  It is always fully reversible and editing a closed question always nominates it for re-opening."
796,"The problem here is that question's topic doesn't have anywhere currently that it would belong within the StackExchange network. For Android.SE, the relevant section of our FAQ is: What kind of questions can I ask here? Please note the following topics are expressly off-topic here: It's the last (of my quoted) bullet points that's important. This site is for users of Android, the question was about publishing an app in the Market, that's not a user topic. Discussions on these parts of the FAQ are primarily here FAQ: “What kind of questions should I ask here?” and FAQ: “What kind of questions should I NOT ask here?” As for StackOverflow, their FAQ says: Frequently Asked Questions What kind of questions can I ask here? Stack Overflow is for professional and enthusiast programmers, people
who write code because they love it. We feel the best Stack Overflow
questions have a bit of source code in them, but if your question
generally covers … This question isn't covered by any of those question types, so they're not going to accept the question if it's migrated back. Arguably they should never have migrated it here, but just closed it there, but not every mod knows the exact scope of every other site and mistakes are unfortunately made. There is a proposal on the Are 51 site to create a StackExchange site dedicated to App Stores, if that proposal gets enough support, and the site is created, then that would be the natural home for this question. Until that day, it appears that unfortunately there is currently no good home for the question."
1501,"The short answer, of course, is that you can't expect decisions made by humans to be consistent. The longer answer is that what's off-topic and on-topic is not determined by one user's comment on a question, but by the democratic process of voting to close. On a wider scale, discussion here on meta sets a written policy for what is on- and off-topic, and it's then down to individual users and moderators to decide each question. App recommendations and other kinds of ""shopping advice"" are off-topic because they're often opinion-based and subjective. Sometimes the only objectively correct answer can be the list of search results from Google Play: but this is only correct until someone releases a new app, or discontinues an old one. Questions where you have a specific problem to solve - one that you can't easily search for in Google Play - are on-topic even if the answer happens to be ""such-and-such app can do that"". Different users and moderators draw the line between those two kinds of question in different places. Some users are very quick on the trigger, and close any question that includes, ""Is there an app that can do this?"" to encourage the questioner to think more about the problem he's trying to solve (and to edit the question accordingly). Some users are more inclined to look to the underlying problem and ignore the exact wording of the question. Of course, because the decisions are made by the community, whether a borderline question is closed or not depends on who voted that time, and maybe even on what mood they were in that day or how well they understood what the question really meant. Requiring five votes to close a question smooths out the inconsistencies somewhat, but it's still easy to find pairs of similar questions where one was closed and one wasn't."
1160,"The only flags that need to be responded to quickly are spam, threats, and those where people have included personally identifiable information. All others can wait until they're gotten too. A Diamond should also have a light touch. An awful lot of things that are flagged shouldn't be. A Diamond should be fair, firm, and consistent. A Diamond should have a sense of humor, not take themselves too seriously, and recognize when they're not mentally well-equipped to deal with a situation. A Diamond should be in constant contact with the other Diamonds. Not necessarily to ensure consensus on every decision (although consensus is important) but so that they all know what's going on and to provide support where needed. A Diamond should expect to answer fewer questions and to spend a little time on the site every day, several times a day."
762," Matthew Read answered: Android is by-and-large a fantastic site low on the problems faced by many other SE sites.  I don't see any policing aspects to the moderation job here and, regardless, it has to be about serving the community.  If you're not serving the community then you're not doing your job as a mod.  Matthew Read continued: If a community were to be so far gone that you need to really police it, cracking down on questions the community wants and so on, then probably the site isn't viable and I would have expected the team to step in and shut it down before that point.  Al Everett answered: ""Policing"" is looking around for bad actors and problems and doing something about it. ""Serving"" is, to me, is finding what the community needs and working to provide it. I think a moderator needs to do both, but as little as the former as possible to keep things civil.  eldarerathis answered: I'd say it's a bit of a fine line between the two. ""Policing"" to me implies being a bit more active in exercising moderation powers, whereas ""serving"" is a bit more passive, like responding to community flags and such. I would also say, though, that carrying out community consensus without always needing their explicit request (i.e. rules which were decided upon on meta) is serving - not policing. That's where I would generally fall.  Matthew Read clarified: I think I may have interpreted ""policing"" too harshly, based on Al and eldarerathis's answers :P I agree with dealing with problems and not being passive!  Bryan Denny answered: Policing is a bit too strong.  Policing happens when I only want to see things I want to see on the site rather than what the community wants to see. I should be here to facilitate (serve) the community, not my own whims  Flow answered: Serving the community. Policies can change. In fact the should be adjusted from time to time by the community. That assures a healthy climate and progress."
