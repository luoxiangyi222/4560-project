1382,"This is actually a result of a different scenario, but from the front page it's effectively indistinguishable from a normal Community♦ bump. What actually happened here was: In this situation, Community♦ (evidently) becomes the ""owner"" of the last modification to the post since it would otherwise end up being attributed to a non-existent account. In fact, clicking on the timestamp for the last activity on the front page will link you directly to the deleted answer."
1469,"No, those questions aren't on-topic.  The reason is fairly straightforward &mdash; this site is for end-users.  Curiosity is a valid reason for asking a question, but at the end of the day we expect questions and answers to be applicable in some way to a problem faced by an end user. The closest we get to your last question, for example, would be when an advanced user wants to have an extra script or app run on startup.  This would be a valid question for us, and the answer might involved a partial description of the boot process, but laying out the whole process in detail is going to be a lot of extraneous information that our audience simply cannot make use of. Your questions might be on-topic on Stack Overflow but again, it would be best if you could connect them to a problem.  If you were creating your own ROM and modifying boot if not the source code then there would certainly be many reasons to ask those sorts of questions. I think your GPS question is not the most solidly in-scope, but acceptable.  As an end user, you made an observation about something your phone was doing, which resulted in the question."
1210,"When you see a post here on meta titled ""2012 Community Moderator Election Results"" you'll be able to read it and know what the results were. That'll usually happen somewhere between 10 minutes and 24 hours after the election ends.  Of course, someone will probably post the results in chat between 10 and 24 seconds after the election ends. But if that's still not quick enough for you, you can download the OpenSTV software and election data and run it yourself (both will be linked to on the election page immediately after the election ends). How long that takes is up to you. "
1729,"Why wouldn't we? We already accept questions about samsung-galaxy-gear, which is the same class of thing. In general, we have a lot of questions about using Android with certain peripherals, such as Bluetooth keyboards. Since Android Wear is essentially a Bluetooth peripheral that's only for Android devices, it seems even more on-topic."
944,"It's done for Search Engine Optimization, because question titles often don't explicitly mention the common names for their topics. Sounds like you'd be interested in this question on the main Meta site: Should we stop adding the most popular tag to the HTML title on every SE site? One instance where tags aren't added to the title, is if the tag is already included in the question title, eg Any Android phones that don&#39;t support Bluetooth? (random example from the current front page) where the title already includes the word ""bluetooth"" so there's no need to add the tag. This could be what you're seeing in the instances when the tag isn't added to the page's title, and it's just coincidence that most of those happen to only have one tag. Here's an example with more than one tag Connecting Android to Ford Sync via Bluetooth?  where the tag isn't added, as it's mentioned in the question title."
2617,"I don't think so; such questions are broad, open ended and don't have a definitive best answer. Therefore, they're not a good fit for Stack Exchange's Q&amp;A format. See also the Help Center article What types of questions should I avoid asking?: You should only ask practical, answerable questions based on actual problems that you face. Chatty, open-ended questions diminish the usefulness of our site and push other questions off the front page. Your questions should be reasonably scoped. If you can imagine an entire book that answers your question, you’re asking too much. Older Stack Exchange might still have some of these questions, but they're often locked and they're just kept for reference and not for maintenance."
1701,"There could be a couple of reasons for this. If you have a specific question in mind that you'd like an explanation for then feel free to point it out and I (or someone else) can take a look, but off the top of my head a few possibilities would be: If the question's last activity is attributed to Community♦ and there are no edits/modifications, then it's often (but not necessarily always) because Community♦ will periodically bump old unanswered questions to the front page, to give them additional visibility. I don't know if this is really explained anywhere, but the profile description for Community♦ does note this. If a question is reopened, it will get bumped to the front page, but there isn't any immediately obvious activity on it. You can see the close/reopen activities in the post's revision history, though. It's possible that someone posted a comment, spam, or other non-answer as an answer, which was then subsequently deleted. You'll still see the activity on the front page of the site, but you won't be able to see the deleted post without 10k reputation, so it will seem like some kind of phantom activity took place. If the account is a spam account, then it may be destroyed, which will attribute the activity (on the front page) to Community♦ instead of the original poster. I may be missing some other situations here as well, but I would say that these are the most common on our site."
2012,"These questions are not considered to be within our scope: Please note the following topics are expressly off-topic here:
   ...   They were determined to be too problematic because they generally lack lasting value, often attract spam, and often end up being more popularity contests than anything else. Such questions are also sometimes viewed as inherently being ""help me Google this"", and therefore don't mesh well with the goal of building a knowledge repository outside of providing a link or pointer to elsewhere. You could consider asking for recommendations in chat, if you'd like."
1828,"If you meant by this,  It actually shows the last activity on that post, excluding the deletion. Most possibly, here is the actual timeline: Hence, it shows Darshak Parikh's answer as the last activity."
2488,"Depends on what kind of flag – and then how active the ""workers"" on the corresponding queue are. You wrote you flagged a question off-topic: if that was done via ""vote-to-close"" it ends up in the ""community review queue"", waiting for 4 more community members to agree – or disagree. Depending on that, when 5 close-votes (or less but a mod throwing the final one) have accumulated, the question is closed. As you mention your flag having been ""declined"", that rather sounds like you've flagged it for mod attention. Then it was most likely declined as it (no longer) matched, as you assumed. Talking about mod flags: No, usually not. We (mods) might decide the flag is invalid – but we usually check if it was raised in good confidence; in which case we ""dismiss"" it as ""helpful"". If you indeed marked it for mod attention: better ""vote to close"" for being off-topic (no need to raise it for a mod, our community can deal with it fine – and we mods are participating in that as well). If instead you raised a ""regular flag"" (i.e. used the ""close"" link – unlikely, as you'd need a little more rep for that), please clarify. I'm not aware of ""declining"" in that context – after all, those are not really ""flags"" but rather ""votes"" (hence ""vote to close"", not ""flag to close""). Also note you can always retract such a vote. That said, thanks for bringing it up – last but not least as a reminder for us mods to better look twice before deciding to ""decline"" a flag!"
