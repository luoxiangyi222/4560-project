822,"I normally save the &lt; kbd > tags for actual hardware buttons (or at least buttons that are normally hardware even if they're sometimes soft) like Power, Menu, Home, Back, etc. For menu options and clicking on items on the screen I'd normally either bold them (or for long options like descriptions on tick boxes ""enclose them in quotes"". So for your example I'd say Settings -> About phone -> Android version Or Settings -> Display -> tick ""Auto-rotate screen"" Or giving a Xoom the ""three-fingered salute"" would be hold down Power + Volume Up at the same time."
1973,"After discussing with two to three people and posting this type of question, I found that  No one has any objection on these type of question.  Since it is not possible for all to know about the file standard of android these type of questions will be helpful for people like me. I wanted to know where the saved wifi-passwords are stored and I got an answer from this SE site and therefore I wanted to know about the other files stores in same directory as that of the file which contained the saved wifi passwords.  So this type of questions can be helpful this way. Best Regards, Jasser"
972,"Both underscores and asterisks work for italics, it has nothing at all to do with the button.  Basically you've confused the parser that converts the Markdown to HTML. You have to escape the underscore with a backslash: *kernel\_config.gz* Which shows as: kernel_config.gz"
77,There are now several people is one lonely guy with 1000+ reputation. (Didn't we get temporary mods?) This is probably no longer necessary.
2308,"I use Arch Linux, and have instaled ttf-google-fonts-git. Roboto has always been a part of the package. But the site still looks awful on my computer. When I was typing this as a comment, I couldn't see what I'm typing well enough. Though I can see this just fine when typing in the Answer section.  If you must use Roboto, please use Roboto-Medium or Roboto-Regular instead of thin or light variants. The site is currently unusable for me. And please set up fallbacks for people who don't have Roboto."
2347,"As with the CyanogenMod nightlies, or any ""pre-beta"" ROM, they should be closed. The problem, whatever it happens to be, is probably not widely applicable, and is likely to be fixed in the short term. That makes the question virtually useless for future readers. Just close them."
615,"I think it makes a lot of sense to split these up sensibly, I'd propose something like this Do we really need an app-blocking tag? The one question that I think you're nominating for it, is really a PC question rather than an Android one (and quite an edge case even there) I'd think it would be better off on SuperUser than here, and even then I think ""locking"" is probably closer to what is happening than blocking (seems to be to do with locked handles on mounted drives/files).  *I'd think that call-blocking should be set to a synonym of call-screening (as surely blocking is just a type of screening where you don't allow the call through after screening it). One of the call-screening questions even mentions blocking in the title."
313,"I can type into the search box, but I can't seem to get it to submit. When I click the Enter or OK buttons it just seems to change focus to another field. Similarly, I can't figure out how to close the messaging bar at the top of the screen. I can't scroll far enough to the right to close it. Not sure if it matters, but this is with a Motorola Flipside running 2.1."
2095,"I agree with Al's point. Of course the natural mechanism of the system takes care of such bad/strange answers. However, in some cases, it can be hard giving a very specific answer, thus resorting to using  ""I think..."" or ""Your best bet probably is..."" or ""I haven't tried this app so I don't know but..."" ""I think"" at this point, ""your best bet probably is"" that not everything that works on my phone will work for someone else's phone. Android is Android, yet there are so many caveats, that make giving certain answers sometimes hard to do in different situations. Until one has had the opportunity to use over the 10,000 different types of devices that exist today, I doubt anyone can give 100% certain answers on everything. For instance, in answering this question, I used the expression, ""could"", pointing out that, I'm not certain. Although TWRP saved my life some time ago on my Z2, does not necessarily mean it will work for this OP. I wasn't certain it will work, not because I don't know what I was saying, but because what works for me is different from what will work for someone else. Of course, outright nonsense answers need to be flagged, yet, the idea of suggestions aren't all bad, as what works for me won't work for my friend next door, always! TL;DR Not knowing an answer to a question is different from not being certain something'll work for the OP. Thus, I don't think the use of ... ""I think..."" or ""Your best bet probably is..."" or ""I haven't tried this app so I don't know but..."" ... is entirely a bad thing."
419,"Since we're focused on Android, not iDevices, I don't think we need to be as ""strict"" about being very specific about devices or the distinction between hardware and OS. I think the only tags we need are iphone and maybe ios. If the type of device is really that important to the question, then it seems to me that the question is probably off-topic. By the by, some of the questions you're running into were migrated from the defunct gadgets.stackexchange.com. Android and iPhone were both on topic. Not sure if we should bother resurrecting those."
