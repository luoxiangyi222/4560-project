596,"I would tend to agree. Go ahead and start hitting that ""edit"" link. I have updated the tag-wiki for pc to direct people to more specific tags. It might help."
2427,"Done. Please go ahead and post your comment as an answer now. Thank you for asking here instead of taking the easy option by not posting an answer at all. If you're interested, this particular question was protected because of a flood of ""I have the same problem"" answers from new visitors."
493,"I think a big issue is going to be finding relevant conferences. Google IO sold out in a ridiculously short time, plus I'm pretty sure they don't put out a call for speakers. AnDevCon was OK, but I was pretty disappointed in it as an advanced Android user/developer. Might need to look to some more general conferences such as MADExpo which I saw advertised on MSDN. After a conference is found, finding a speaker shouldn't be a problem: there are plenty of Android fans and developers with plenty to say."
2089,"I too think it is pretty much off-topic. Example 1: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one should I buy? We simply can't know the expectations and parameters of choice of any person. Example 2: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one is
better? Since utility of a good is not quantifiable, the answers are going to be pretty much subjective and opinion-based. Example 3: I want a phone with following specs: blablabla Can you guys suggest any? There are websites that find phones with the desired specs already."
1597,"Scripts can have accounts too. It would be easy for a spammer or other malicious user to sign in and then give control to his script. Having the possibility of a CAPTCHA for signed-in users prevents this attack. The system has a few ways to guess whether particular activity is from a genuine user. Full details aren't available to us end-users, because that would make the system too easy for attackers to defeat. One common way to make the check go wrong is to leave a page open for a long time before submitting the form; for example, you start to answer a question, then get interrupted, go to lunch, come back an hour later, finish answering the question, and then get the CAPTCHA when you try to post your answer. This is because of a token in the page that expires after some time."
872,"Unfortunately, the name ""Android Enthusiasts"" is so close to generic that it's very unlikely we'd be able to stop them from using it. However, our wonderful core developers have told me it's pretty easy to make that hyperlink in the Google results say ""Android Enthusiasts - Stack Exchange"" rather than ""Android - Stack Exchange,"" so that change will be implemented soon. If you're looking to become their friends, maybe a representative from this site could join one of their future hangouts as a special guest? Just a suggestion; interact or don't interact with them as you wish. :) As Matthew Read pointed out, this site is the top Google hit when searching ""Android Enthusiasts"" so there's nothing to worry about right now. They probably just didn't know this site exists and already uses the name they decided to adopt a week ago."
792,"I am very unlikely to root my device, so I don't really have any skin in this game. That said, I do believe the current canonical question is getting too big and unwieldy. I think ""How do I root device X"" or, even better, ""How do I root Y class of devices"" is a good way to go. I'm concerned, though, about the different ways one can root a device. I would caution against ANY ""how do I root device X with method Y"" questions. I also agree with Flow in that these shouldn't automatically go to Community Wiki. It will take work to put this information together; the people who do should get the reward. We also have a slew of closed questions that can be re-opened and answered. That should make the askers happy. (Although that's not a reason to do this.)"
1995,"As I mentioned already in the comments, Don't delete your answer unless it's not useful. It has three upvotes
  and the OP may have rewarded you the bounty since you have put your
  efforts into solving the question or the bounty was going to expire. I
  don't think its mistakenly rewarded. Even your answer doesn't solve
  the OP's problem it can still be useful for him and other future
  readers. Your answer becomes a solution only when it is accepted by
  the OP. So I guess you're okay there."
318,"I did not do the downvote, but I think that question is downvoted because the question is not an Android question and so is out-of-topic for this site. Also, even assuming that it is on-topic, the question does not provide enough details to provide any useful answer, such as who your carrier is and device you are using. But, don't take the downvote too personally, people downvote for various reasons: A single downvote does not mean the community is rejecting the question any more than a single vote means you're going to be the next president."
357,"The look and feel of Android Patterns is another neat site. as for the front page especially and the questions, it would be cool if they were composed along the lines of the the system status window shade:   obviously we'd have more horizontal space to work with, but stretched it would fit the stack aesthetic pretty well. The little bumper at the bottom would be a fun trick to play around with if we were going to have a page/comment load transition."
