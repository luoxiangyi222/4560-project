697,"I really like the idea, I think there are a lot!! Here there are some of them: Block all sounds going out through speaker when headphone connected How can I fix the WiFi button or prevent WiFi errors when turning it off and back on?"
475,"Sure. There are plenty of great topics for blog posts that can hopefully go far above and beyond being a mere reference answer for common questions If this gets traction, coordinate with rebecca@stackexchange.com and she can get a provisional blog set up."
1663,"It's nothing to do with the number of URLs... It's how they're formatted:  Since there are no spaces, the URL parser thinks the entire string  is a URL - and of course, this is not a valid URL! There are a few possible work-arounds here: Leave off the  This is the easiest, since the URL parser will just ignore it - but it also changes the actual error message, so this is somewhat undesirable. That said, in this specific case you shouldn't actually be passing ""http"" to telnet anyway.  Use code formatting for the URL. Surround the URL in backtics, and the URL parser will ignore it. Example: Connecting To  not open connection to the host, on port 23: Connect failed Put the entire error in a code block. By indenting four spaces instead of using the > prefix, the error message will be rendered as code and ignored by the URL parser. The downside of this is that it will all appear on a single line: Use HTML blockquote syntax. By eschewing Markdown entirely, you can obtain much greater control over what is rendered. So writing this: ...produces this: Note that you'll have to escape any invalid HTML in the quote in order for this to work. "
443,"Despite what I just said, on Matthew Read's answer, I'd support merging ""Ubuntu"" and ""Linux"" -- if we aren't going to distinguish every single operating system by version (which sounds to me like crazy talk ... every Mac OS? Every Linux distro and release? Eeek.) there's no reason to break out Ubuntu from Linux."
588,"The choices have changed. I suggest that the correct reason is now ""Not Constructive"". As it currently stands, this question is not a good fit for our Q&amp;A format. We expect answers to be supported by facts, references, or specific expertise, but this question will likely solicit debate, arguments, polling, or extended discussion. If you feel that this question can be improved and possibly reopened, see the FAQ for guidance."
1549,"If you don't take any time to learn anything about the site you're visiting, it's not going to work for you.  Start here. We're not obligated to help you, and we are a community-led site.  Driveby comments that can be left by anyone are not in our best interest.  You will notice that you don't even need to sign up to post a question or answer, however. Without knowing what question you're referring to or what your comment would be, it's hard to help you further."
1748,"I'm not totally against this idea, but it would often require the user to research something they may not have been prepared to.  Any barrier to posting has to be carefully considered so quality is balanced with ease of use, since the longer it takes the more likely the user is to go somewhere else.  It's also definitely not up to just the user to define how a tag will be used on the site, and we do have some guidelines and particular formats for types of tags."
1013,"It seems to me that the answer you refer to is trying to answer the question behind your question. It is, at least, an attempt to answer some aspect of your question. By and large, Moderators are going to be conservative about deleting answers; they'll only do so if it is an obvious non-answer. Frankly, I think your question is off-topic. Certainly it's not an Android-specific issue. All that considered, it's the community that decides. You've received an answer and you've commented that you don't think it is and your rationale. That's good. The community seems to not agree. Re-flagging in hopes of getting a Moderator to issue a different decision is a little disingenuous. (There's an obvious parallel to a child not getting the answer she wants from one parent and going to ask the other parent the same question.) That you've raised the issue here on Meta is fine, as any discussion that can help improve the site is welcome."
2089,"I too think it is pretty much off-topic. Example 1: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one should I buy? We simply can't know the expectations and parameters of choice of any person. Example 2: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one is
better? Since utility of a good is not quantifiable, the answers are going to be pretty much subjective and opinion-based. Example 3: I want a phone with following specs: blablabla Can you guys suggest any? There are websites that find phones with the desired specs already."
1162,The flavor of Markdown that Stack Exchange uses doesn't support this. I would be against it in any case. Underlines are very commonly understood to indicate links when on web sites. You mess with this very basic and well-understood UI element at your peril. (I can't tell you how many times I've been on some web site and tried to click underlined text and nothing happened.) See also: Why can we format text with bold and italic but not underline? It's been brought up before and unless you can devise a compelling new argument it's not going to be implemented.
