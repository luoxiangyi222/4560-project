2214,"Actually, though the animation is done by an event listener (as Matthew pointed out), there's no userscript needed. You can easily fool the javascript part by setting the animation duration to 0s in CSS: That did it for me at least."
2160,"eldarerathis recently split off that section to give it more prominence, which is great.  I think you have a fair point about the wording, though.  I've added this line: Creating or modifying custom ROMs is also off-topic. I think that should be sufficient, but let me know if not."
1710,"Adding the tag to your favourites doesn't actually create the tag, so it doesn't matter whether you have enough reputation or not. It just adds that tag name to a list in your profile. If a tag is subsequently created with that name, the tag will be in your favourites; until then, it has no effect. If there's an error here, it's only that the behaviour is a little confusing. BTW, there's not much point adding a new tag if there's only one question it relates to. Tags with one or zero questions are automatically removed after some time. We also wouldn't normally add a device tag to this particular question, because it doesn't appear to be specific to this model: the same problem could just as easily arise with a different device."
2001,"Here is the breakdown: You had 1+5+2=8 points until an hour ago.      Then you received a downvote on a post of yours which took two points out of the total, ending up at 6 points.  Now, you pretty much had it all figured out, but you're missing the point stated in help center here: (Emphasis mine) This is simply what happened. You received a single downvote (that -1 between the arrows) on your answer which took away  two points from your account and one point from the user who downvoted it."
792,"I am very unlikely to root my device, so I don't really have any skin in this game. That said, I do believe the current canonical question is getting too big and unwieldy. I think ""How do I root device X"" or, even better, ""How do I root Y class of devices"" is a good way to go. I'm concerned, though, about the different ways one can root a device. I would caution against ANY ""how do I root device X with method Y"" questions. I also agree with Flow in that these shouldn't automatically go to Community Wiki. It will take work to put this information together; the people who do should get the reward. We also have a slew of closed questions that can be re-opened and answered. That should make the askers happy. (Although that's not a reason to do this.)"
1657,"I would keep the tablet tag. But I would also have kept the phone tag, as I think that there exist questions that are only relevant for phones and tablets. Please don't confuse this with irrelevant tags added to posts. If a question isn't phone specific, there is no need to add the phone tag. Side note: But there is also no big harm in adding it, as long as the tag doesn't occupy the spot for a more relevant one."
1545,"5 points is the number of reputation points you receive when someone votes one of your questions up. It's most likely that someone who had voted up one of your questions in the recent past has been banned or deleted, so their impact on the site has been automatically reversed. See also: “User was removed” means I lose my hard-earned points?"
875,What did we end up with? Which solution should be used? I like the idea about the highest number of reputation points in a week..  What did the staff decide?
60,"QR codes are great.  Just make sure to also make the images a link to what the QR code is pointing to (for people who are browsing this site on their phones). There is also an ASCII QR code generator, but not sure how well they'd work here."
2299,"From my point of view, that very much depends on the intention. As you already pointed out in your question, there are many occasions where those tools are of benefit to the end user and thus should be on-topic. Examples include, but are not limited to: Others are rather in the scope of development and hence should be off-topic. Again, some non-exclusive examples: Summed up: if those questions target end-users, even power-users, they should be on-topic. If they (primarily) target development, they are off-topic. That was as we've always dealt with it, and IMHO we should continue doing so."
