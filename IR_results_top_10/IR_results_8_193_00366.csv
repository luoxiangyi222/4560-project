62,"I would say [Android-2.2] or [2.2]. I have no idea what most of the code names refer to, and the phones specs I see online only give the version number, not the code name.  I use a phone with android 1.5 - I know it is 1.5, I don't know what variety of food I would refer to it by. And you could tell me in the comments, but I think most new-ish users would have no idea."
841,"I think you're seeing one of two behaviours that changed recently with @replies. Essentially the @reply isn't auto-completed (and is often removed when you post) if there is only one possible, unmistakable person who's the target of your post and so your @name bit would be redundant. So if you're making a comment on a question that has no answers, and it's the very first comment, then you are obviously making a comment to the questioner, so adding @name is redundant. The other thing that's changed is that when SE thinks that two people are having a conversation (when there's only two of you commenting and you're going back and forth between you) then the @name is removed too, as it's obvious who you're talking to. In these cases even though there's no @name in your comment, because it's obvious who you're talking to the person that you're talking to will still get notified that you're talking to them (for instance question askers are always notified when someone comments on their question with @naming anyone else)."
81,"My two cents: The dessert names of the versions is fun and all, but most of your normal users aren't going to have a clue as to what it means. Further, it doesn't appear on the phone, while the version number does. So, at best, our dessert names should only be synonyms. I wonder if the naked [2.2] isn't a bit too esoteric. But, then [android 2.2] and [version 2.2] are redundant if clearer. (The former also has the added benefit that if there were a merger in the future, or Android forked into multiple product paths, no global renames would be required. That's probably not something we should be worrying about, though.) So, I say [&lt;version number&gt;], with [&lt;dessert codename&gt;] and [android-&lt;version number&gt;] as synonyms. Update: The community isn't playing along. android-2.2 x 50 2.2-froyo x 24 froyo x 6 2.2 x 1 1.5-cupcake x 3 android-1.5 x 2 android-2.1 x 34 2.1-eclair x 8 2.5-gingerbread x 1 (which is just plain wrong; everything I've seen indicates Gingerbread will be 3.0, except for this, which implies that Gingerbread might be 2.3) I still stand by my suggestion of raw version numbers (e.g., 2.2) as best, with tags in the style of android-2.2 as second best. Not everyone knows about the dessert names, and if Google stops naming their versions that way it's not going to make any sense. Tags based on the official names is more future-proof."
2504,"I disagree that answers containing dead links to Play/Whatever Store are useless or should be deleted. There are usually plenty of places where you can find apks, so answer with dead links at least tells that some app exists. I think you should undelete such answers.
Maybe only answers containing links to apps which require some kind of web service which is down forever e.g. clients for dead social network should be deleted. Looks like all apps from your example only changed names and package names and are still available on Google Play: Graffiti for Android, DioPen, PenReader. Anyway old apk versions are also available from first pages of google search (of course user should be careful with these) or e.g. from 4pda.ru. As for AppBrain I don't really like it because of this:

Got it after ~5 pageviews. I'd prefer links to WebArchive instead (or maybe to both of them)."
136,"No, that's by design. Any new usernames must be three characters or more. So cherish that rare two character name on Stack Overflow. See: Prevent (or at least notify about) display names shorter than 3 chars"
83,"My first thought with all of these is to err on the side of being a little verbose.  I like the format [manufacturer]-[model-name]: htc-droid-incredible, motorola-droid, motorola-milestone, etc.  That way phones with really short names don't get an ambiguous/confusing tag like x. It does become a little unclear whether ""droid"" is officially part of the name for some models, though (for instance, is it the Incredible, or the Droid Incredible?)"
1821,"I agree that we need clearer description about our chat room. Currently, it doesn't really tell anything, including the misunderstanding between general topic and programming-related (also, as seen on the main site...). The least we can do is to make them notice before they enter the room, which is the job for chat room's description. As for the name, actually I don't really have an issue with it. Of course, unique and memorable name is better if possible. My idea is more-or-less like this: Droid Lover A place to have general discussion about Android. If you have a problem related to Android app development, please go to Stack Overflow or its chat. Finally, relax, and enjoy the sweets! (feedback and corrections are really appreciated since I'm not a native speaker)"
55,"I say use the name of the build: Donut, Eclair, Froyo...  Merge them all into this. The number isn't bad but it may be confused with other app version names, or other relevant numbers. Using ""Android-2.2"" is pure redundant silliness.  Why should we have to specify that we are talking about ""Android"" on the ""Android Enthusiasts"" StackExchange?  "
872,"Unfortunately, the name ""Android Enthusiasts"" is so close to generic that it's very unlikely we'd be able to stop them from using it. However, our wonderful core developers have told me it's pretty easy to make that hyperlink in the Google results say ""Android Enthusiasts - Stack Exchange"" rather than ""Android - Stack Exchange,"" so that change will be implemented soon. If you're looking to become their friends, maybe a representative from this site could join one of their future hangouts as a special guest? Just a suggestion; interact or don't interact with them as you wish. :) As Matthew Read pointed out, this site is the top Google hit when searching ""Android Enthusiasts"" so there's nothing to worry about right now. They probably just didn't know this site exists and already uses the name they decided to adopt a week ago."
