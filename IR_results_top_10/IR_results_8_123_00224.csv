1947,"That one seems a bit borderline to me. The reason used, ""Questions which are Android-independent...are off-topic..."" is technically correct. I'd expect that Instagram in iOS would act the same way.  But it's also not like you can go to the website and create an account; you can only create an account by installing the app. So I think the question is fine here, even if the answer is probably ""you can't""."
917,"The best you can really do currently is to create a new room and then invite the user to that room. You can also leave a link to the room as a comment on their post if you want. The automated chat link will also create a public room, so from that regard it's essentially the same (and you can give it whatever title you want). One downside is that the auto-inserted link will import the comments from the post into the chat room when it's created. Creating your own room beforehand will not do this, but if you are pre-emptively setting up a chat with someone then there is likely not going to be a long comment thread to import anyway, I'd imagine. This has also been discussed on Meta Stack Overflow."
886,"Nope.  Once you create a bounty, you lose that rep forever.  I think you used to be able to award it to yourself but it ""didn't count"", and now it's just the more sensible solution of not letting you award it to yourself at all. If someone else is able to help or independently discovers the same fix as you, you may want to consider giving them the bounty.  Otherwise just let it expire &mdash; if it does without you awarding it, half the rep will go to the highest-scoring answer if it's at +2 or more, if there is such an answer.  (If not, no one gets any.)"
867,"I'd be careful about merging the 'contacts' and 'people'. Isn't the app in HTC Sense called ""People""?  Also, 2.x and 3.x versions of Android are going to be around (and generating questions) for quite some time yet. I think Matthew Read's suggestion of creating ""contacts-app"" and ""people-app"" is a good one, although I don't think I'm in favor of making one a synonym of the other. They will at least offer a way to distinguish from questions about contacts in general."
2031,"Yes, please edit them! Better grammar makes a post more readable - everybody benefits. A few caveats though. Don't go ""fixing"" American English into British English or vice versa.
And while editing, try to fix as much as you reasonably can - the right capitalization, markdown, and removal of noise.   On Meta Stack Overflow, I created a proposal for a FAQ with help for editors. While that post is aimed specifically at Stack Overflow, I believe that most of it will be helpful on other sites as well. "
2132,"This was discussed in Is it ever acceptable to prod a user into accepting an answer? and in the posts linked there. The comment by Jeff Atwood is worth repeating: I would only remind users who have shown signs they are going to stick around. Reminding a drive-by user isn't useful. A drive-by user might have posted their question on five forums, got an answer at three, of which they read one - and it wasn't yours. Chances are they'll never be seen again, at least not from the same account. So the comments just create noise for others reading the post.  Other things to consider:"
2588,"Only Stack Exchange staff can merge an account. From the screenshot, assuming that you are this user, please use the contact form to report this. From the help center, If you have two accounts that you would like to join together, please sign into either account, visit the contact form and select ‘I need to merge user profiles’. After you contact us, the Stack Exchange Team will reach out to verify that you own both accounts. If we can confirm your ownership, we will initiate a merge. If you can't remember how to log in, go here and enter the email address you used to create the account you are trying to sign into."
2483,"A sincere thanks to the community for reposing your trust and confidence in me to be a moderator. Dan leaving us was known since he communicated his reasoning on Meta. It was an unpleasant surprise but  I fully respect his decisions.  Matthew leaving is a shocker coming out of the blue. At a personal level, I wouldn't have been an active member of this community without him guiding me out of (self created) mess. As they say of Veterans Old soldiers never die, they fade away ; leaving behind their imprints and inspiring us to do better. I wish both  veterans, the best and hope that they do not go off the radar and continue to help the community. "
2392,"This is to inform everyone that I've created tags the following tags: nokia-x
nokia-xl
nokia-x-plus
nokia-2
nokia-3
nokia-5
nokia-6 The nokia was supposed to be created so that when a question is on a new model of Nokia smartphones, there is at least one tag present. But with advice from @Izzy, I didn't create it at the end, keeping in mind that some or the other high reputation users or moderator would create the required tag, if they happen to come across the question. @NVZ has added the tag nokia-8."
2584,"In 2012, there was only Google Drive app for editing Documents, Slides, and Presentations. On June 2014, Google released standalone editor apps for each file: Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides. (Ref: Google Drive Blog) We recently launched mobile apps for Docs and Sheets that allow you to create and edit files on the go, even if you’re offline. We’re rounding out the trio with a new Slides mobile app that’s available starting today on Android and in the coming weeks on iOS. Thus, the current synonymization of google-docs to google-drive can be considered confusing and degrading the user experience. With this:"
