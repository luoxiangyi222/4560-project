497,"This is better explained over at meta.stackoverflow.com. In short, community wikis are discouraged because they encourage ""subjective"" and ""open-ended"" questions.  But sometimes they do make sense.  For example, we have a CW on rooting phones. I believe they removed the option for users to make their own posts into a CW.  Instead, only moderators can make a post CW. 9 times out of 10, a question that ""should be CW"" probably should be closed due to being subjective or not a real question."
2035,"What is the actual use in grouping phones by chipset?  This site is for end-users, there is going to be virtually nothing relevant in common between two phones from different manufacturers than both happen to include MediaTek chips."
687,"I think only #2 is acceptable, though it might be closed as a dupe.  #1 and #5 are way too subjective, #3 is an off-topic shopping advice question, and #4 isn't a question :P.  (Note we don't take speculative questions either, which applies to most questions about 4.0 and the Fire right now.) If a contest wants to use questions here I think they still need to be real questions, real problems, asked and answerable from a user's perspective."
1210,"When you see a post here on meta titled ""2012 Community Moderator Election Results"" you'll be able to read it and know what the results were. That'll usually happen somewhere between 10 minutes and 24 hours after the election ends.  Of course, someone will probably post the results in chat between 10 and 24 seconds after the election ends. But if that's still not quick enough for you, you can download the OpenSTV software and election data and run it yourself (both will be linked to on the election page immediately after the election ends). How long that takes is up to you. "
475,"Sure. There are plenty of great topics for blog posts that can hopefully go far above and beyond being a mere reference answer for common questions If this gets traction, coordinate with rebecca@stackexchange.com and she can get a provisional blog set up."
841,"I think you're seeing one of two behaviours that changed recently with @replies. Essentially the @reply isn't auto-completed (and is often removed when you post) if there is only one possible, unmistakable person who's the target of your post and so your @name bit would be redundant. So if you're making a comment on a question that has no answers, and it's the very first comment, then you are obviously making a comment to the questioner, so adding @name is redundant. The other thing that's changed is that when SE thinks that two people are having a conversation (when there's only two of you commenting and you're going back and forth between you) then the @name is removed too, as it's obvious who you're talking to. In these cases even though there's no @name in your comment, because it's obvious who you're talking to the person that you're talking to will still get notified that you're talking to them (for instance question askers are always notified when someone comments on their question with @naming anyone else)."
29,"I think a lot of good points have already been made here but after taking a look at the existing questions, I really think people need to take a good hard look at this: Edit - I missed a few, and more just keep coming and coming... Guys, this is seriously awful.  We are just one day into the beta and out of 109 questions on the site, 22 of them (over 20%) are about which apps are ""good/bad/best"" - yikes! Worse, almost none of them are Community Wiki, so people are actually gaining rep for asking and answering the most mundane and subjective questions imaginable. I think this list very dramatically illustrates the problem with allowing these questions.  There's no end to them.  What's the best compass app?  What's the best flashlight app?  What's the best ukelele simulation app?  Gah! Is this what we're going to be, just a glorified review site?  Is it really that hard to just go to the market and read the reviews?  The Android developers have already built us this beautiful rating and review system that you can access right on your phone.  We don't need this fluff. Please, please, let's start closing these questions.  At the very least close them until we have moderators who can properly wikify them, but even then, I don't want to see people's 1-line recommendations taking up 20% of the site.  This is turning into a land grab with everybody wanting to own one of the big bad 500+ upvoted poll questions.  If we don't nip this in the bud, it's going to bite us hard later on. P.S. I'm not saying every question about an app is bad.  Here are two that are fine: In the first example, somebody is looking for a very specific app and has provided criteria to significantly narrow down the list of candidates.  In the second example, the author is asking for a comparison of two specific apps.  I see no problem with either of these. I just don't want to see two hundred ""Post your favourite [X] app"" polls by the time we hit public beta."
443,"Despite what I just said, on Matthew Read's answer, I'd support merging ""Ubuntu"" and ""Linux"" -- if we aren't going to distinguish every single operating system by version (which sounds to me like crazy talk ... every Mac OS? Every Linux distro and release? Eeek.) there's no reason to break out Ubuntu from Linux."
1618,"Regarding some of your specific examples: This seems like a bug rather than a ""real"" Android issue - Google Nexus 7 not recognized via USB I don't really see why that's a problem. People sometimes encounter bugs when using Android. Trying to find a workaround for a bug (if that is the case) is a perfectly reasonable problem to want to solve. How is that not a ""real"" Android issue? What would be your definition of a ""real"" Android issue if not an issue you encountered while trying to use Android? Did this break the rules? - What's the risk of installing Cyanogen Mod on unsupported phone? Do you have a specific reason why you think this question is off-topic? What about it is not related to using Android? This seems like a reasonable question for someone unfamiliar with Android/CyanogenMod to ask before they dive in and get themselves stuck in a bad situation. Too Localized? - How to connect your Nexus phone to a VGA projector? I suppose I could see this being kind of a niche question, but I don't think I'd go so far as to say that it's ""too localized"". That close reason doesn't actually exist anymore as it is, but when it did exist it was generally intended for problems that were only reproducible in the environment of the OP, or questions that were (or would be) rendered obsolete quickly over time. On Stack Overflow a common use was for questions where the error was a typo. Anecdotally, I had my boss come ask me how to do exactly what this question describes before going to a meeting once (he needed to demo an app for some potential clients). Now, regarding the general quality of the site: yes, we have over the course of this site's existence had a persistent problem with low quality questions, in my opinion. I think part of the problem is that there are a lot of questions that people want to ask that just don't fit on SE sites, which we have chosen not to accept (""Recommend a phone for me"", ""Help me find an app"", etc). There's not a whole lot we can do about these other than to point people to resources that will be able to (possibly) help them, like forums and such. We also regularly get questions that are just not answerable because they are too vague, usually with regards to bugs or other problems. ""My messaging app is force closing. Help me?"" is not descriptive enough for us to be helpful, for example. However, I would say that every site ultimately ends up with questions like this, particularly ones focused on end users (though, Stack Overflow certainly gets plenty of dev questions that are simply remarkably poor). Again, we just have to be diligent in keeping the site clean of these questions, and trying to guide the askers into posting more detailed questions. In sum, I'm not really sure what the end goal of your post is, honestly. I personally don't find the questions you list to be particularly ""fuzzy"" in terms of their appropriateness, and you haven't really provided specific portions of the on/off-topic guidelines that you think need to be tightened. This makes it kind of difficult (for me, at least) to really provide much in the way of meaningful discussion on the perceived issue. When you suggest: Should the rules be made more clear?  ...then I would recommend that you point out specifically the parts that you find unclear so that we can discuss them. Alternatively, perhaps you could explain what you think the appropriate topics of our site should be, and why. That would at least give us somewhere to start, but definitely do explain clearly the ""why"" so that we can accurately evaluate the merits of your stance."
367,"You could find one of their posts and leave an ""@name"" comment for them on their post. This should then appear as a notification for them next time they're on the site, but this isn't a forum or a chatroom, so that should be used sparingly. Perhaps that could be used to invite them to the Android room on  where you can actually have a real talk, and possibly swap enough contact details that you could then have a private conversation."
