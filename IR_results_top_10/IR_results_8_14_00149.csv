625,"This bug was the result of some related back-end changes, which will be corrected in the next build.  Kinda glad this broke, an even earlier change could be made even faster/cheaper for the wiki-redirect case...and now is."
2038,"If the changes to be made are so minor that you can't find anything else to change, then just move on. In my experience, there is rarely a post that needs edits where there is not more than six characters to fix. Even so, there are plenty of other posts that are in serious need of editing. Once you get to 2000 reputation you won't have to worry about it."
1458,"This is a Stack Exchange network thing, and the general explanation (as described on Meta Stack Overflow) is: We don't usually require sticky IPs (in particular once you're logged
  in it shouldn't be an issue), but if during the process of logging in
  your IP address changes, that's extremely fishy, and that's why we
  bail out. It's hard to say for certain why this would be happening, but my guess would be that Opera's Turbo service is distributed over a number of proxy servers, and so your requests in the middle of the log in process ended up coming from different physical servers, and therefore resolved to different IP addresses. Turning off Turbo would cause all requests to originate from your device without travelling through the proxy, so it would make sense that doing so would prevent the rapidly changing IPs and allow you to log in."
1273,"Alternative spellings are good, because they provide different search paths.  Editing a post just to change ""wifi"" to ""Wi-Fi"" would seem to me to be the very definition of a ""too minor"" edit. Like a lot of tech terms, there is no universally accepted spelling. (Not to say that there aren't style guides that try to standardize on one or the other, but we don't adhere to one of those.) Now, if you'd spelled it as ""wife"" (as I've done more than once) then it should definitely be fixed. Otherwise you've got a question better suited for marriage.stackoverflow.com. Similar to how we don't change posts from British spellings, I think for the most part this should just be left alone."
1148,"I've re-opened it.  I don't think one person verifying that they can see the buttons is enough to say that no one else will be unable to see them, like you.  I can't think of any reason why this would be happening to you and only you, so I think it passes the ""potentially useful to others"" metric. The nature of the question obviously changed due to the comments, however &mdash; it's some combination of your account/location/environment/app version/etc. and the particular apps rather than something about the particular apps that affects everyone.  I've edited it as such, please make sure to do such editing yourself when possible.  Secondly the question would benefit from extra information, such as:"
1180,"As The Andro Nerd said, you have the option of just making your 1st Choice selection and the others will be ignored. Just note that in this voting system, if your candidate ""doesn't make the cut"", you will have no voice at all in what other candidates will be chosen. If you have already cast your votes, you can change them back to ""no vote"" by changing your choice then changing it back. Since you can have only one of each choice, if you select someone with the same choice it will remove it from the other person. Here, this should illustrate: Suppose you start out like this: You really just want to vote for Person A. You can do that with a couple of steps. Just change your vote(s)."
311,"I don't think that's necessary. For one thing it's not a change that would be all that universal. What use would, say, English.SE have for QR codes? Besides, the new web market puts QR codes right on the page. It's only a couple of clicks to get the URL for the image and add it to a message. "
2091,"5 minutes from the time of your initial vote. In other words, you can change your vote as many times as you want within that initial 5 minutes. Changing your vote does not reset the timer."
2405,"I think it's important to look past the words the questioner happened to use, to see what the intent of the questioner is, and I wish close-voters would put a little more thought into that. This isn't 3-2-1, and you shouldn't lose everything just because you happened to use the magic word ""app"" in your question. Recommendation questions are opinion-based. They ask for lists of answers, and they tend to get spam answers as a result. The answers are less useful than Google Play search results, because they go out of date quickly. This is why we don't like them on the site. Which is the best music player? or Is there a good third-party SMS app? These are simplified examples of bad questions. What kind of answer will they get? A million answers saying ""I like such-and-such app, it's the best"" with no justification. An answer with a one-off copy-paste of Izzy's app lists, which will slowly go out of date or need editors to keep updating it over time. I have a bunch of CSV files in Google Drive and I need to download them when they change and add the results up. Is there an app for that? or I play games on my tablet with my kid ""helping"" sitting on my knee. He often grabs the rim of the tablet and pokes the volume button and makes it really loud. I need the volume buttons turned off when I'm playing a game. Is there an app for that? This doesn't seem like a ""recommendation"" question to me. What kind of answer will it get? There still might be more than one. It might say, ""Use such-and-such app, it can do this out of the box,"" but more likely, it'll say ""You have to install Pushbullet or IFTTT to find out when the file changes, then use Tasker to schedule downloading them and open Excel for Android to load the CSV files,"" or ""You need a custom ROM for this. Lineage can do it."" The difference is, you can replace ""Is there an app?"" with ""How do I solve my problem?"" without really changing the meaning of the question. In the recommendation questions, you can't do that. I think that's the crucial difference. If I find a question like this second pair of examples in the close vote queue, I'll typically make that edit so that people don't close the question, but I don't think the edit should be needed. Just because someone thought an app is the most likely solution to their problem, that doesn't turn a good problem-solving question into a recommendation question. I think we should all apply that test in our head: can I replace ""is there an app?"" with ""is there a solution?"" without changing the meaning of the question."
