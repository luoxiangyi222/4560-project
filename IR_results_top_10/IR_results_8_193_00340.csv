399,"My part in that conversation started because travis said that his phone had the same problem as the OP's, so at first I was trying to find a common thread between their two devices. If they were both running ROMs running Sense UI that would suggest that perhaps it wasn't necessarily a hardware-specific issue and those of us trying to help should focus more on their particular firmwares and not just the phones themselves.  When travis said he didn't know I wanted to try to be clear when explaining to him what he needed to know in order to give me a useful answer. I hope that clarifies my seemingly off-topic comments.  :)"
393,"I think for that particular question it's okay. The issue doesn't appear to be device specific, so the steps JonnyP is suggesting should help both people. If Travis had opened a new question, we almost certainly would have closed it as a duplicate of this question. That's not to say that it's okay to hijack someone else's question, but that in this case I don't think it's out-of-bounds."
1682,"The +100 rep association bonus is not counted in the protection algorithm. The post notice states (emphasis added): To answer it, you must have earned at least 10 reputation on this site. and the ""on this site"" part is actually quite literal, though not entirely clear. Therefore, looking at your rep history, you've got +100 for the association bonus and +5 for an upvote on one of your questions. That nets you 5 rep from your activities on this site, which is still shy of the 10 needed. There is also a more detailed explanation of the ""protected"" status on Meta Stack Exchange, for reference. In this specific case, the view count of the question is pretty low, so I'm going to remove the protection. It looks like it was applied because it picked up a bunch of non-answers within the first 24 hours, but then the views petered off after that."
587,"I wouldn't mind a Bluetooth headset. Gift certificate for the Android Market/Amazon App Store/et cetera? I suggest against a case. There are too many form-factors out there. I've already got one, but one of the plastic Android toys would be cool to give away. There's some new cool ones out: "
2132,"This was discussed in Is it ever acceptable to prod a user into accepting an answer? and in the posts linked there. The comment by Jeff Atwood is worth repeating: I would only remind users who have shown signs they are going to stick around. Reminding a drive-by user isn't useful. A drive-by user might have posted their question on five forums, got an answer at three, of which they read one - and it wasn't yours. Chances are they'll never be seen again, at least not from the same account. So the comments just create noise for others reading the post.  Other things to consider:"
1013,"It seems to me that the answer you refer to is trying to answer the question behind your question. It is, at least, an attempt to answer some aspect of your question. By and large, Moderators are going to be conservative about deleting answers; they'll only do so if it is an obvious non-answer. Frankly, I think your question is off-topic. Certainly it's not an Android-specific issue. All that considered, it's the community that decides. You've received an answer and you've commented that you don't think it is and your rationale. That's good. The community seems to not agree. Re-flagging in hopes of getting a Moderator to issue a different decision is a little disingenuous. (There's an obvious parallel to a child not getting the answer she wants from one parent and going to ask the other parent the same question.) That you've raised the issue here on Meta is fine, as any discussion that can help improve the site is welcome."
1773,"Custom flags (those raised using the ""other"" reason) are intended for things that cannot ordinarily be handled by the community. These flags go directly to the moderators, whereas other flags will go into various review queues that can be acted upon by other users of the site. Someone saying ""thanks"" is simply not something that is generally going to require direct moderator intervention. It is not actively harmful to the site, and there are tools already available to you that are appropriate for the situation: Secondly, as Dan alludes to in his answer, if you do use the ""other"" flag reason, you need to be really, excruciatingly specific in your message. Your flag is basically telling us ""Hey, something is wrong, and I, as a regular user, am unable to handle it with the current tools. I need a moderator!"" Entering your flag description as ""saying thanks"" doesn't provide us with enough information to act on. In the context of this flag, you actually raised two separate flags on the same post, one minute apart from each other. The first is the flag you noted above. The second was a flag on one of the comments on the post. Moderators cannot respond to comment flags, so we had to respond to the post flag instead, which appeared to be connected in purpose to your comment flag based on the timestamp and the content of each flag."
928,"The problem is that no one can predict if an answer to those questions will every be backed by facts or references. Typical examples are ""Why does Google not allow one to X?"" and such. The probability is high that no one can give facts or references if he is not a Google employee. That's why those questions are often closed, because most answers can only be speculative. In fact, that is true for all questions which involve company policies and decisions. Regarding the question from you I am not sure if this applies here too. There could be someone with a deep knowledge of Android who can answer this in an good way, so that it fits SX's QA policy. That is why I have voted to reopen the question. I think overall we should wait before we close such questions. If the answers are only of speculative nature, then the question can be closed (and deleted) later on."
1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
525,"Well, I've installed it on my own site. I've also got the Chrome extension to be able to use it anywhere. I think it could easily go with the Facebook and Twitter links we have already."
