2099,"Answers don't determine whether questions are duplicates. If an answer needs updating or another needs to be posted you should do one or all of: However, I'm pretty sure you're not correct about all of those changes since 5.0, since I was able to find and add methods that definitely work on some 5.1 and 6.0 devices.  Try it out. You should also look at my second answer.  This is not supposed to be possible for you to bypass, especially not with a locked bootloader.  That's the entire point of the feature."
311,"I don't think that's necessary. For one thing it's not a change that would be all that universal. What use would, say, English.SE have for QR codes? Besides, the new web market puts QR codes right on the page. It's only a couple of clicks to get the URL for the image and add it to a message. "

2323,"What's the intent of OP? ...Changing the date and time in the phone can ""evade"" the version and trial and continue to use it Further, they want to know .... if it was possible to change the date of a single app even by changing the source code of 'App To my mind, there is no ambiguity around that Is it legal ? - we are not equipped to discuss Is it ethical ? To me clearly, NO Could OP have other valid reasons for asking , which might have triggered this question ? - possible,  but if not stated, let's not assume either ways but go by what's presented ( also note that there was no response to my first comment, stating that it is unethical ) Should we permit such questions (not withstanding the fact that a diligent search on Internet would reveal ways and means ) ?? Emphatic NO"
1382,"This is actually a result of a different scenario, but from the front page it's effectively indistinguishable from a normal Community♦ bump. What actually happened here was: In this situation, Community♦ (evidently) becomes the ""owner"" of the last modification to the post since it would otherwise end up being attributed to a non-existent account. In fact, clicking on the timestamp for the last activity on the front page will link you directly to the deleted answer."
1995,"As I mentioned already in the comments, Don't delete your answer unless it's not useful. It has three upvotes
  and the OP may have rewarded you the bounty since you have put your
  efforts into solving the question or the bounty was going to expire. I
  don't think its mistakenly rewarded. Even your answer doesn't solve
  the OP's problem it can still be useful for him and other future
  readers. Your answer becomes a solution only when it is accepted by
  the OP. So I guess you're okay there."
264,"I definitely see now why it makes sense not to do this kind of tagging -- clicking the tag will show you all the questions where the user has Device X, when you really want to see all the questions about Device X. That said, many questions need device and OS info, and the tags are a convenient place to put it, for consistency reasons.  The information is always in the same place and clearly distinct from the question, so the potential answerer doesn't have to search the question for it (or remember it all as they read the question). I think the optimal solution would be to have separate fields for device and OS version that the asker could fill in if it's relevant.  The info could be shown in a separate box or something at the end of the question.  I'm not sure how much work this would be for the SE people or if it's desirable to modify this site / some sites this way, since it's clearly not applicable across the board.  Perhaps instead the FAQ could show a standard template that people should insert at the end of their question, something like:"
792,"I am very unlikely to root my device, so I don't really have any skin in this game. That said, I do believe the current canonical question is getting too big and unwieldy. I think ""How do I root device X"" or, even better, ""How do I root Y class of devices"" is a good way to go. I'm concerned, though, about the different ways one can root a device. I would caution against ANY ""how do I root device X with method Y"" questions. I also agree with Flow in that these shouldn't automatically go to Community Wiki. It will take work to put this information together; the people who do should get the reward. We also have a slew of closed questions that can be re-opened and answered. That should make the askers happy. (Although that's not a reason to do this.)"
625,"This bug was the result of some related back-end changes, which will be corrected in the next build.  Kinda glad this broke, an even earlier change could be made even faster/cheaper for the wiki-redirect case...and now is."
1066,"I am undecided. This are two different things, although there are  very few  questions. I would let them separated for a while and see how things go."
