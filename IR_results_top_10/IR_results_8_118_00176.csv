654,"call-log, call-logs, call-logging -> call-history history was removed, browser-history created logcat -> logging, which is now used for system and other miscellaneous logging logs was removed, I figure it's too ambiguous to be merged with anything else"
867,"I'd be careful about merging the 'contacts' and 'people'. Isn't the app in HTC Sense called ""People""?  Also, 2.x and 3.x versions of Android are going to be around (and generating questions) for quite some time yet. I think Matthew Read's suggestion of creating ""contacts-app"" and ""people-app"" is a good one, although I don't think I'm in favor of making one a synonym of the other. They will at least offer a way to distinguish from questions about contacts in general."
1397,"Unless there's an actual app called ""RSS Reader"" that will be the source of questions, this seems like a reasonable merger to me. Although, honestly, the question counts are so low we should just edit them. If the tag resurfaces later then let's create a synonym."
1947,"That one seems a bit borderline to me. The reason used, ""Questions which are Android-independent...are off-topic..."" is technically correct. I'd expect that Instagram in iOS would act the same way.  But it's also not like you can go to the website and create an account; you can only create an account by installing the app. So I think the question is fine here, even if the answer is probably ""you can't""."
666,"Not sure about smartphones. But there is also tablet, so maybe it makes sense to keep the smartphone tag also. I am in favor of blacklisting mobile-phones and cellphones. Matthew is right: If the phone functionality in question is calling, calls is the tag to go. And for everything else, mobile-phones and cellphones is to broad and inaccurate."
615,"I think it makes a lot of sense to split these up sensibly, I'd propose something like this Do we really need an app-blocking tag? The one question that I think you're nominating for it, is really a PC question rather than an Android one (and quite an edge case even there) I'd think it would be better off on SuperUser than here, and even then I think ""locking"" is probably closer to what is happening than blocking (seems to be to do with locked handles on mounted drives/files).  *I'd think that call-blocking should be set to a synonym of call-screening (as surely blocking is just a type of screening where you don't allow the call through after screening it). One of the call-screening questions even mentions blocking in the title."
229,"It like creating a site devoted to ALL MICROSOFT PRODUCTS. People will be asking questions about the intricacies of configuring Exchange Server, F#.NET libraries, and the best ways of using Bob."
1742,"Guest accounts are just like any other account, they stay until you delete it yourself, or merge it into another account. The main disadvantage of a guest account is that it is only associated to you by a temporary cookie. As you don't have an actual login and password, there's no way to log into it from another PC or device, and if the cookie expires then there's no way to access that account again. If you have an existing guest account that you've used to post a question or answer and you'd like it merged into your new registered account, see this help page: I accidentally created two accounts; how do I merge them? "
314,"I wouldn't even bother with the search function here. While they've recently improved it, Google (and even other web searches) are still far superior. site:android.stackexchange.com searchterm in your Android/Google search field should find you what you need. As for the other issues, this site isn't optimized for mobile browsers (seems like a no-brainer to me) so that there are ""wonky"" things with the interface doesn't surprise me, nor do I think they'll be a high priority. However, someone has created a mobile-optimized ""proxy"" for the Stack Exchange network, called Stack Mobile. You might try that and see if that works better for you. "
622,"Frankly, I think questions like this should be closed as ""too localized"", but I'm afraid we're going to keep getting them. They're way too localized. Even a question like ""what's new in Android 4.0?"" would be marginal (I'd point them to Wikipedia, I look up what's new in each Google Chrome release on Wikipedia for example). An 2.3.x release on a specific phone model (I'm assuming vendors tweak each release?) is incredibly localized and trivial."
