1311,"What circumstances is a general all-round ""yes you can"" or ""no you can't"" going to be useful? Are you just going to spend days throwing random commands at your tablet in random ways, or is there something specific that you're trying to do? What are you likely to be doing that has a chance of bricking your device? A question like ""Is there a chance rooting my device using the FancyNamed Rooting Method could brick my device?"" is answerable, (and will probably already be answered on the support thread for which ever rooting method you use). Your question as it is at the moment is very broad, has a lot of unknowns, and isn't really answerable with any answer that will stay the test of time."
120,"We might also find great benefit in sharing this with Motorola, Samsung, HTC, etc. on-line communities and forums. I think it would be a great opportunity if we started sharing answers, links, etc. at these places! The idea would be to attract users without harming what they have going on already.  What's the best way of doing this? Any other suggestions?"
2167,"Rooting, custom ROMs and the like become off-topic Definitely not. They are a genuine part of Android to many of us. While I agree that many of those questions are of poor quality â€“ that doesn't make the topic poor. I agree with Matthew here: And this is how I deal with those usually: So if OP improves the question in a way it ""becomes useful"", I immediately re-open it. If not (and as long no one starts a discussion in the comments), Roomba will take care for it. This is what we address in several places already, e.g.: Looks sufficient for me. These we often close as off-topic already, and point the OP to the corresponding forums, bug-trackers, etc. We could ""enforce"" this a bit more, maybe, via a separate post on Meta with a strong consensus declaring them ""off topic"". Still, a ""gray area"" might be left with us (how to tell when it's a ""clear bug report"" or a misbehavior caused by other reasons?) If you'd ask me for what I'd declare off-topic, I had a clear candidate though: 95% of the WhatsApp questions fall into that category (""Android independent""). But not being an expert in ""asocial media"", I keep my fingers off of those :)"
525,"Well, I've installed it on my own site. I've also got the Chrome extension to be able to use it anywhere. I think it could easily go with the Facebook and Twitter links we have already."
1374,"As I just wondered again about the development tag (and why there are only so few questions tagged such), maybe a sum-up from the above might be helpful: So here's probably the clue why there are always only few questions found using this tag: they simply get deleted :) This way we 10k+ users can use our powers to support our moderators (and) keeping our site clean -- and not only we 10k+, but all users can participate here (e.g. re-tagging does not require a 10k+ but only 500+)."
1182,"Bad Example: URGENT HELP NEEDED - Galaxy S Problem! Good Example:  Samsung Galaxy S keeps restarting itself randomly. How can I stop this? Every non-native speaker is welcomed to ask questions (and provide answers) on Android Enthusiasts, but we expect a minimum of readability. Errors are human, nevertheless please try your best to write in grammatical, correctly-spelled English. What have you already tried to solve the issue?  Providing those can help avoid answers/comments with suggestions that you have already tried unsuccessfully. Don't try to emphasize a word by writing it in Caps (e.g. ""IMPORTANT""), use bold tags (""important"") or italics (""important"") instead. Don't ask about your attempted solution, instead ask about your actual problem. That is: if you are trying to solve problem X, make sure to ask about X and not about potential solution Y. The daily question limit is high, so please use separate questions for separate issues.  Asking about more than one question in your post will only cause confusion. A picture is worth a thousand words, but try to keep pictures in a reasonable size; huge pictures make it hard to catch the whole idea. It's hard to read a wall of text (example). Make use of Enter once in a while. 1 Although not strictly required, it's often a good idea to phrase the title as complete sentence."
2270,"Unfortunately, for some phones, bloatware will inevitably be installed on the phone if third-party tools are used. Usually, rooting would involve this: Of course, a custom recovery won't introduce bloatware in 99.999% of cases. The zip file, provided you use one that is from a very reliable author, is also bloat-free. Now, some phones go through this process: This is where things can go many ways. Your phone's fate depends solely on the authors of the tool. Some tools, such as towelroot, probably do not care about profits and as such simply does their job (rooting the phone) and nothing else. Unfortunately, other tools (like KingRoot/KingoRoot) do care about profits. To answer your question, unless you know how to deal with low-level stuff instead of using third-party tools, bloatware is inevitable. Since you already acquired root, you can probably:"
1995,"As I mentioned already in the comments, Don't delete your answer unless it's not useful. It has three upvotes
  and the OP may have rewarded you the bounty since you have put your
  efforts into solving the question or the bounty was going to expire. I
  don't think its mistakenly rewarded. Even your answer doesn't solve
  the OP's problem it can still be useful for him and other future
  readers. Your answer becomes a solution only when it is accepted by
  the OP. So I guess you're okay there."
294,"Well, on meta.stackoverflow they use faq-proposed. Seems reasonable to me. Especially since some people have already started using it: "
2358,"Many common link-shorteners are already blocked by the site because of the problems that they pose. As a general rule, editing the post to replace the shortened links with regular ones is the right way to go, and the same applies with ad-based shorteners. If you feel a specific user is especially overbearing with the links then leaving a comment may not be a bad idea. Flagging one of their posts for the mod team to look at is also a reasonable option, particularly if you find the links to be of questionable usefulness and more for the purpose of driving traffic through the link service."
