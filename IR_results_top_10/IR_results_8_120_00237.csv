105,"ElectricSheep.com (as in ""Do Androids Dream of..."") is taken, but there's no real content there. I don't know if they'd be amenable to a purchase offer. Of course, there's Philip K. Dick's heirs who might have something to say about it."
62,"I would say [Android-2.2] or [2.2]. I have no idea what most of the code names refer to, and the phones specs I see online only give the version number, not the code name.  I use a phone with android 1.5 - I know it is 1.5, I don't know what variety of food I would refer to it by. And you could tell me in the comments, but I think most new-ish users would have no idea."
846,"As a new user i know i don't have something to say.
But personally i had never heard of this site before Android Guys wrote an article about your competition, and it was perfect because i had a question which i have looked for in the past month and haven't found any answers too. And suddenly i had a chance to both get a answer on my question and a chance to win a tablet. It was a win win for me, and since i made my user here, i have tried to help a couple of users, and i am pretty sure i will stick here for a good while, because i like the way the site is build and how it is working. So even though i'm a new user, and don't have anything to say, then you should know that the audio competition worked on me :) [off topic]BTW: how do you run this site, there aren't any commercials on the site. Where do you get the money to run the server and buy the prices in the competitions? [/off topic] "
328,I asked the other StackExchange moderators and they say that the mod tools appear for 2k rep on beta sites.  Otherwise I'd say the alert is just being wonky of telling you about the tools.
2232,"I don't know if there is general SE guidance on this, but I would say yes &mdash; clear cut cases seem like a good place for flags.  This site is not at the point where moderators need to heavily triage flags, as yet.  That said, I also go fully through most queues regularly, so a flag is not strictly necessary."
737,"It would be more accurate to say ""None that I know of"", because there can perfectly be one, including a private one. Also Stackexchange aims at being a knowledge base, with long term questions and long term valid answers. A ""No"" or ""Not at this time"" is not a long term answer. But actually the question itself is poorly written. It should be ""What application does ..."", having no answer until such an application exists."
2066,"I would say that if the person does not ask about the shopping but about the hardware, then it is off-topic because of recommendations. If there was a question like  I need a phone that matches the specified criteria then I would say that it could have luck on Hardware Recommendation. As long as it is not a question discussing price."
1762,I would say they are on-topic. However...
533, says they're the same. I'll create synonyms. Update: This is now complete.
849,I can't repro. are you saying that you can't see #f6f6f6 bgcolor?
