579,"I think part of it is the type of user we attract, for whatever reason.  Most people seem to come looking for a quick fix to a problem and then leave.  Like I've said before, I've seen the same problem on XDA.  Lots of users who take a little and give nothing. I do wonder if that's just how users break down across the Android platform itself -- hardcore early adopters, and then a bunch of people for whom it's just a phone.  Not a ton of power users who aren't experts.  If that's the case, it will take extra effort to bring in a disproportionate number of those users until the platform matures and we get those users naturally. I've also seen several users get excited for a week or so, answering a bunch of questions ... and then leaving, before really reaching the middle-class you speak of.  I'm pretty confused as to why that happens."
1157,"I have nominated myself, so I think I should provide an answer. I believe that a Diamond Moderator should be active, as well as there. They would need to respond quickly to flags - so they can be dealt with. They would also need to have a good rep - so that people can see that they are trustworthy, as well as having been a member for a good while. I believe that a diamond moderator should always shed some light on their decisions - I know this is hardly possible, but I believe that they should comment, and help new members follow the site rules, and stay on topic. I know this has been quick - but this is what I believe."
1419,"As there (currently) is no way to ""categorize"" related tags, it might also be a good idea to sum them up in the ""most generic"" tag of the group to make them easier to find. For example, the security is such a ""quite generic"" tag. So its tag-wiki could contain a list of related tags such as '2-step-verification', 'malware', 'antivirus', 'lost-phone', and the like. Having such a list in a ""single place"" (i.e. the ""declared master-tag"") makes them easier to manage as well: other places (e.g. other tag-wikis) could simply refer to that place (""for other related tags, also see..."") -- and the ""related-list"" would only need to be maintained once."
2598,"First of all, welcome to Android Enthusiasts Stack Exchange, a Q&amp;A site focusing on Android end-users solving their issues. Consider taking a quick tour to get a short introduction on how Stack Exchange works in general. Regarding the reason why the question was closed, ignoring the fluff/rambling, there are at least more than 1 tangential questions: While all of them are related to audio volume, solutions to one issue are possibly unrelated to other issues, making it unfocused (previously known as ""too broad - multiple questions on a single post""). The problem with multiple questions on a single post is, answerers are expected to solve all the issues, preventing them from posting an answer if they only know the solution to an issue or two. Evaluating the answers also becomes difficult since an answer may contain a good solution to one issue but poor solution to another, while another answer provides vice-verse, making it a confusing situation for the voters and future readers. Take note that developer-related questions (like asking for the API and how to build a ROM) are generally discouraged since the user-base of this community is Android end/power-users, but not necessarily developers. The fix is to separate these issues into multiple posts, one focusing on a specific topic. Before posting a new question, please also search for existing questions to prevent duplicates."
60,"QR codes are great.  Just make sure to also make the images a link to what the QR code is pointing to (for people who are browsing this site on their phones). There is also an ASCII QR code generator, but not sure how well they'd work here."
888,"Why not create fm-radio as well, retag the existing radio and radio-firmware questions as necessary, and make radio synonym to one of the tags (not sure which one should be most appropriate, probably fm-radio since it's most commonly associated with ""radio"" out of context). cellular-radio is also a good idea, although I am not a big fan of tag proliferation."
1940,"For this one, I still think that your question is on-topic on here. From help center, If your question generally covers... Yes, the question is about using Android device to boot an ISO file. Whether if it's possible or not, we don't know yet, but that doesn't make the question off-topic. I also don't see any off-topic reasons that can be applied to your question. Please note the following topics are expressly off-topic here: On the other hand, using mobile-related device is off-topic on Super User. and it is not about â€¦ As I see, your question is not about using PC to interact with Android device, making it off-topic there."
872,"Unfortunately, the name ""Android Enthusiasts"" is so close to generic that it's very unlikely we'd be able to stop them from using it. However, our wonderful core developers have told me it's pretty easy to make that hyperlink in the Google results say ""Android Enthusiasts - Stack Exchange"" rather than ""Android - Stack Exchange,"" so that change will be implemented soon. If you're looking to become their friends, maybe a representative from this site could join one of their future hangouts as a special guest? Just a suggestion; interact or don't interact with them as you wish. :) As Matthew Read pointed out, this site is the top Google hit when searching ""Android Enthusiasts"" so there's nothing to worry about right now. They probably just didn't know this site exists and already uses the name they decided to adopt a week ago."
1190," Flow answered:  I don't think that it will influence my behaviour. I always try to show my best side and put in my best effort.  Liam W answered:  I guess I don't know what I feel. It shouldn't influence my behavior, and I will probably continue posting as I do now, but probably with a more 'formal' attitude (if I believe it is needed, for example when commenting on a closed post due to a duplicate). Most likely, it will stay the same as it is.  Suraj Bajaj answered:  That would make me feel more responsible. Though my efforts will continue to be the best, I will have to put extra time as a moderator. As a moderator, my actions on the site should be an example to the AE community."
2157,"You are right in a lot of ways: And so on. However, the site is not ""going down the tubes"" because this is not new.  We have always dealt with high numbers of these questions, and right now our activity levels are pretty consistent with the past. Making rooting questions off-topic is not really an option.  They can be perfectly good questions and answers (example) and are obviously highly relevant to many Android users.  Many of our most active users are also experts on those types of questions &mdash; it is a core part of the site. I also don't think that separating them out into another area/site will help.  One of the biggest issues we have here is people who completely ignore our existing types of off-topic questions, so such separation would (a) be ignored and (b) not reduce the number of low-quality questions in any way. Instead, I think we should focus on how we can improve them.  We've slowly been forming many ""canonical"" questions for common issues; continuing this is important so that we can quickly mark relevant questions as duplicates and reduce the clutter.  There have also been some suggestions that we ask SE to alter the Ask Question interface to have some sort of warning about our scope and the required level of detail which would be helpful if we could convince them to add it."
