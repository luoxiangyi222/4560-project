2387,"The bounty amount is deducted from your reputation when the bounty starts, not when it's awarded. For the particular example you mentioned, you can see exactly what happened on the reputation tab of that user's profile. They started with 1 like everyone else, got +100 of association bonus, and then spent it on the bounty to get back to 1 rep. They also got an upvote on the question taking them up to 6. Spending one's association bonus to bounty one's first question on a new site is pretty common but it's quite unfortunate, because you have to get all the way back up to 110 reputation before you can answer protected questions."
2411,"I don't think there's any way to get a notification, but after a question is migrated, the original question gets a banner to say what site it was migrated to, with a link to the question on the destination site."
1277,"Per this answer from Jeff Atwood at Meta Stack Exchange: Expletives are not acceptable behavior on meta or any other Stack Overflow site. If you can't effectively communicate what you need to say without resorting to lowest common denominator cursing, then keep it to yourself. If you use expletives, you will get a warning. If you continue to use expletives, you will be placed on timed suspension. While Jeff has left Stack Exchange this is still official policy. It would also be considered a violation of the Be Nice policy 1. I would suggest that profanity, especially if directed at someone, falls under &quot;Rudeness and belittling language&quot;, while run-of-the-mill &quot;blue&quot; language just in general is covered under &quot;Don't be a jerk - Inappropriate language or attention&quot;. (&quot;Vulgar terms&quot; is specifically called out.)"
475,"Sure. There are plenty of great topics for blog posts that can hopefully go far above and beyond being a mere reference answer for common questions If this gets traction, coordinate with rebecca@stackexchange.com and she can get a provisional blog set up."
277,"It looks like Bryan Denny's How do I root my phone? would be a perfect place to consolidate this, and a great resource to point all the rooting question-askers at. If he's happy for his answer to be Community Wiki'd, then it could be treated as a shared resource to put all the info in, the same way that the ""When is my phone getting [OS]"" questions are pointed to the two ""When will my phone get the Android 2.2 update (FroYo)?"" (and Gingerbread) questions started by Al Everett. That way all of the normal ""How Do I Root"" questions can be closed and pointed to Bryan's question, and the more unusual edge-cases can be treated on a case-by-case basis to see if they'll stand as their own separate question (but probably still with a link back to the main rooting question),"
1617,"This seems like a bug rather than a ""real"" Android issue - Google
  Nexus 7 not recognized via USB No matter if it is an bug or not doesn't mean that it shouldn't be allowed here. You can't often tell if it's a bug or just a common user error. Use Google - Is there a valid Android alternative to iTunes U? This is a borderline question, because it's of the form ""Is there an App that does X?"" and should maybe rephrased to ""How can I  (like iTunes U)?"" But then it's a good quality question for this site. Too Localized? - How to connect your Nexus phone to a VGA projector? The too localized close reason is long gone. For a good reason, who can decide how many users are interested in the question? What is they harm if it only helps a handful of people, if it's still helpful? I agree that Cyanogenmod questions should be welcome, but to see an
  ""Android"" site, it seems like Cyanogenmod questions do not belong. This read as you would like to contradict yourself. And I also fail to see an valid argument why Cyanogenmod questions should be disallowed here. If have a feeling that most people would consider Cyanogenmod questions on-topic on Android Enthusiasts. ...but not Raspbian (Install Raspbian on Android (ARMv7) Devices). This was a community decision, The mod that closed the q was only the needed 5. vote. For example, I do not consider this question off-topic, but the community decided otherwise. I am not sure if I get the intention of your meta question. If it's whenever Cyanogenmod questions should be allowed or not, then I say *Yes, Cyanogenmod questions are perfectly fine here"". If it's because you feel the quality of questions has dropped, then I say we have already all the tools at hand to improve the quality of posts: Remember that negative score posts won't get bumped by community on the front page. If they don't have an answer, they also will get deleted after some time."
41,"I would say yes. Certainly for built-in and Google applications. For more obscure application maybe not, but those are less likely to get answers anyways"
1028,"The interesting thing is how many questions of this kind are asked by first-timers (feels like 95% up). It's rarely one with rep coming up with such a question. Next interesting fact is how often the OP shows up afterwards: I'd say 80% up do never show up again, 10% just on the very first day to prove their point and destroy doubts, if possible. Which makes it quite suspicious. Don't take me wrong: The information is freely available if you know the sources, you don't even have to identify yourself to get it. That's why I'd say ""big fish"" never turns up like that (""big fish"" not only knows where the food is, but also ""how to get the crab out of its shell""). So what's left must be either ""small fish"" (those who just ""found"" a single device -- which is not worth the big research and maybe little to big monetary investment), and people of ""legitimate interest"". Not being interested in the former, this leaves the latter. Who are they? People like t0mm13b, who are simply technically interested, or willing to help ""friends in need"" (i.e. people they know). These usually already have a higher rep -- and I see no reason to hide things from them. But then there's the last remaining group: those without any rep, who just f***ed off their device (in this case -- call me bad -- it's a good point to start learning not to fiddle with things you don't understand -- or to be more careful with your sensitive stuff, sorry), or in fact had ""bad stuff happening"" (the brothers little daughter playing with the... how did she get her hands on it?). So my opinion on this: I go with t0mm13b. If technically possible, real sensitive stuff should require a certain rep (at least 1,000+). Everybody below that level could still get the ""obvious legitimate solutions"", such as to specify their Google credentials on a messed-up pattern lock, or see their local Rabbi1... oops, service technician. If it's really your device, you have the papers to prove -- and the solution to your problem is reached faster when taking those papers and looking up a service point (you can return successfully just within minutes) but to prove the legitimacy to ""us"". If it's really a legitimate thing, (s)he will do so. For a petty thief, even this little effort will be too much -- and if it requires more afford, (s)he probably doesn't find it as worth the next time. 1SYLOR is the term for getting sensitive information on e.g. our judaism stack (See Your Local Orthodox Rabbi. Meaning: This is real sensitive (and maybe personal) stuff which should be explained by an expert face-to-face: He can identify you and tell you what you really should know -- as opposed to what you say you need to know -- guess you get my point."

1597,"Scripts can have accounts too. It would be easy for a spammer or other malicious user to sign in and then give control to his script. Having the possibility of a CAPTCHA for signed-in users prevents this attack. The system has a few ways to guess whether particular activity is from a genuine user. Full details aren't available to us end-users, because that would make the system too easy for attackers to defeat. One common way to make the check go wrong is to leave a page open for a long time before submitting the form; for example, you start to answer a question, then get interrupted, go to lunch, come back an hour later, finish answering the question, and then get the CAPTCHA when you try to post your answer. This is because of a token in the page that expires after some time."
