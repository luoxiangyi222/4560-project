1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
2402,"First to read: What is the etiquette for modifying posts? and Why can people edit my posts? How does editing work? The first link is an FAQ from Meta Stack Exchange (aka the main meta), and the second link is an article in the Help Center. It is clearly stated that Edits are expected to be substantial and to leave the post better than you found it. Common reasons for edits include: TLDR The answer is right. Fairly sure I know what will go on... (I will expand this later) It does need a genius to realize that the answer is CORRECT. The current revision of the answer has an emphasis on deionized water, which is the key that makes the answer correct. You'll actually destroy the device if you put it in some random solution, or water collected directly from your tube. Deionized (or distilled) water contains the minimum amount ion possible in chemistry. Random ion in normal water like Calcium and Magnesium and Carbonate is going to react with the material on the PCB and the chips, which is the core cause of water damage. On the contrary deionized water is NOT going to do the same. It does not contain random ion at an amount sufficient to cause chemical reaction. Submerging an affected device in such water will lower the concentration of ion in the sea water (or whatever solution) that's already inside. This will clean off and slow down chemical reaction caused by that sea water, before the device is getting dried. Then the answer requires you to put the device in dried rice, which is nothing wrong. I left out the part that random ion increasing the conductivity of water because that's a really minor factor compared to the damage mentioned above. Blah blah, whatever...aldjgskaksdhsgagkdlalajd"
1549,"If you don't take any time to learn anything about the site you're visiting, it's not going to work for you.  Start here. We're not obligated to help you, and we are a community-led site.  Driveby comments that can be left by anyone are not in our best interest.  You will notice that you don't even need to sign up to post a question or answer, however. Without knowing what question you're referring to or what your comment would be, it's hard to help you further."
902,"Slow down, dude. I see over two dozen flags in the queue. By and large, the community should decide whether questions should stay or go. While we Moderators are part of the community, and part of our job (especially early on) is to help guide the community, the flag queue is really for those situations that the community can't do by itself. A lot of the stuff I'm seeing in the flag queue now are things that the community can deal with. There are plenty of people who can vote to close. We also have enough people to vote to delete. Certainly these questions deserve their downvotes. So please only flag things that need to be dealt with by a Moderator's super powers. It's not like the site is ""full"". A question that's on an obscure topic may still get an answer some day. If it doesn't, then it's lack of votes and views will move it to the bottom of the list."
1016,"This is a new and interesting feature that allows users to spend less effort while doing their part to this community network. The new feature, as any other feature comes with potential bad habits that one may get caught in without noticing. Some that I've noticed across SE are: Clicker happy Experienced users or new users all get involved in such a way that may forget about the real purpose of the review area. Take you time, analyze what you are reviewing: Is there an actual “accept ALL the suggested edits” problem? The usage for competition One interesting part of the new review is that we are able to view who's the top reviewer, what position are we in, and even compare decisions by looking at the review history.  This serves the purpose of providing users a way to improve themselves and refrain from committing mistakes, by learning with others. It is not the Olympic Games, there's no fat payment for the first place, so, don't go voting just because! Vote and review always with the community shirt on. Exaggerated point of view One may get addicted, and as any addiction, there are side effects. If you're tired of seeing what you consider bad answers or bad questions, take a break from review, use the chat to exchange ideas, post a question at META to clarify you point of view. Remember the famous: Could we please be a bit nicer to new users? Don't spend your precious time reviewing just to feel tired and saturated. I'm answering this as to illustrate some of the frequent problems I see on the several SE sites, being discussed on META, and even some that I've personally experienced and/or have been confronted by. Feel free to improve it."
1673,"On-hold or closed questions still have a useful purpose for the site: to serve as an example to others. Every on-hold question (for whatever reason) is an example of what kinds of question we don't want on the site. If a new visitor arrives at the site, looks at existing questions, and notices that (for example) a question about programming has been put on hold, and reads the reason, he'll learn two things: first, that we aren't Yahoo! Answers, and what happens if a question isn't appropriate for the site; second, that if he asks a programming question, it'll be put on hold too. It's an important part of the feedback process, cultivating the community of people interested in the same topic. This is why closed questions aren't hidden from the front page (unless they have a very negative score) or deleted right away. (This is only part of the reason. Deleting them right away would stop the author improving or refining the question so it can be reopened.) There's another side of this: often, when a voter leaves a ""this is off-topic"" comment, the questioner will delete their question right away, without even waiting for it to be put on hold. They're probably trying to be polite and a good netizen: deleting the question after being told it's inappropriate. This is a shame, for two reasons. It defeats the mechanism described above, so we'll end up with more people asking questions that don't fit the site. In addition, sometimes this happens with questions that are borderline, or where the commenter has misunderstood, so the question would not be put on hold. It might even have been an asset to the site had the author not deleted it. For these reasons, I'd like to encourage close-voters to only leave an ""off-topic"" comment in unambiguous cases, to reduce that risk; and I'd also ask those who can't vote-to-close yet to refrain from leaving such comments, and flag the question for a more experienced user to discuss."
917,"The best you can really do currently is to create a new room and then invite the user to that room. You can also leave a link to the room as a comment on their post if you want. The automated chat link will also create a public room, so from that regard it's essentially the same (and you can give it whatever title you want). One downside is that the auto-inserted link will import the comments from the post into the chat room when it's created. Creating your own room beforehand will not do this, but if you are pre-emptively setting up a chat with someone then there is likely not going to be a long comment thread to import anyway, I'd imagine. This has also been discussed on Meta Stack Overflow."
2482,"I thank the community for trusting me with this privilege. I deeply respect that, and I would, to the extent possible and permissible, attempt to ensure that my actions as a Moderator contribute to the betterment of our community. I'm, however, shocked to find three Moderators leaving their diamond privilege in a row. They are some of the most valuable veteran users we have. I've personally learned a lot from them, from their actions as a Moderator and equally from their inspiring high-quality answers.  I'd like to take this opportunity to thank them for serving this community as Moderators in keeping the site tidy and neat to the extent they could, and more so in its troubled times. I hope that they would continue to stay with us, visit us whenever they could, and contribute here with their expertise which we genuinely crave for. :-)"
