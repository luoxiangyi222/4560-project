2214,"Actually, though the animation is done by an event listener (as Matthew pointed out), there's no userscript needed. You can easily fool the javascript part by setting the animation duration to 0s in CSS: That did it for me at least."
1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
2308,"I use Arch Linux, and have instaled ttf-google-fonts-git. Roboto has always been a part of the package. But the site still looks awful on my computer. When I was typing this as a comment, I couldn't see what I'm typing well enough. Though I can see this just fine when typing in the Answer section.  If you must use Roboto, please use Roboto-Medium or Roboto-Regular instead of thin or light variants. The site is currently unusable for me. And please set up fallbacks for people who don't have Roboto."
1828,"If you meant by this,  It actually shows the last activity on that post, excluding the deletion. Most possibly, here is the actual timeline: Hence, it shows Darshak Parikh's answer as the last activity."
2536,"You do not have the privilege to view deleted posts  as of now, otherwise, you could have figured this out yourself. In the last 24 hours, you suffered a loss of 4 points in total, accrued from two suggested edits earlier. The two posts, both questions actually, have been deleted by Community user as part of  deleting abandoned questions. Those two questions were earlier closed, one for being off-topic and the other being unclear, and didn't meet the criteria to stay visible. Deleting a post removes points gained from a suggested edit for that post. Tip: avoid editing blatantly off-topic posts (programming/development related questions), unless for removing personal information, since they should either be closed or be deleted. There is no good reason to improve them. "
