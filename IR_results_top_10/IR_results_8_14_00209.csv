751,"Not sure there. It seems to me that you can talk about one without talking about the other. Can you offer some sample questions where one could be used instead of the other? I expect that there are probably a bunch of questions that are mis-tagged as one instead of the other, but that doesn't necessarily make them synonyms. I don't feel strongly either way, though, so I can be convinced."
716,I'll throw one of my own in: Q: How can I prevent Google Talk from disconnecting? (Jan 2011)
1196," Flow answered:  Active on meta, asking for opinions about how the site's policy/rules should develop. Just query meta for my questions. Although the majority of my meta posts is about tag cleanup work, there are a few others too.  Liam W answered:  Edit and flag history - also that fact that I am currently top of the rep leaderboard for month and week, and second for quarter.  Suraj Bajaj answered:  One of the most active users on the site, one of the top editors (in recent times, as I am a comparatively new user). Top new user...  Suraj Bajaj continued:  Add to that: Being an Android developer and a computer engineer, I am technically sound. :)"
841,"I think you're seeing one of two behaviours that changed recently with @replies. Essentially the @reply isn't auto-completed (and is often removed when you post) if there is only one possible, unmistakable person who's the target of your post and so your @name bit would be redundant. So if you're making a comment on a question that has no answers, and it's the very first comment, then you are obviously making a comment to the questioner, so adding @name is redundant. The other thing that's changed is that when SE thinks that two people are having a conversation (when there's only two of you commenting and you're going back and forth between you) then the @name is removed too, as it's obvious who you're talking to. In these cases even though there's no @name in your comment, because it's obvious who you're talking to the person that you're talking to will still get notified that you're talking to them (for instance question askers are always notified when someone comments on their question with @naming anyone else)."
408,"Love it, love the badge icons and the Andy's holding the banner up at the top, and the overall fairly clean look, with that bit of fun. Not totally convinced about the honeycomb background, but also not sure what it could be replaced with. One suggestion might to do with just making the bar at the top subtly ape the Android notification bar, by removing the background from the top bar, leaving it as a solid colour (or a slight gradient) and left aligning StackExchange logo, while right aligning the search box and icons, username, etc. Anyway love it overall and don't take this as a criticism."
2345,"Not being a gamer I've never heard about Freedom, so I cannot talk about that. LP on the other hand has some very good and ""ethical"" features, but one can be very much tempted using a few of them in an unethical way (which is why I stopped using it years ago, after having given it a short try). It's sometimes a bit too tempting, so I have no clear ""advice"" here. Nevertheless, a possible approach could be: That's quite ""black and white"", and the hard part is where to draw the line. As phrased in my bullet points, there's a wide ""no man's land"" in between which is likely to lead to debates on ""why is this one closed and the other one not"". So while I'm pretty sure about the ""NO"" part, I don't know if we should vote for the other half."
212,"The search engine answer seems the most likely. I know that when I've done a quick Google on answers for some of the slightly obscure questions here, the question itself often shows up in the top 5 Google results. Also, have a look at the questions with the most views, like the Galaxy S GPS problems one. These have thousands of views, and lots of replies from users with just one rep point, that smacks of people who've just found the page through a search engine when they're trying to find the solution to a problem they're having, but aren't sticking around and using the rest of the site."
1674,"I'm partly opposing Dan's answer for the reasons I gave in my comment to it: I doubt there are many ""new users"" doing any research before they post their question. So keeping questions ""as examples how you should not ask"" is a waste, IMHO. I however see a reason to not delete questions which might act as pointers to others. That's best explained using an example:
One of our most frequently asked questions is the ""I forgot my pattern/password and now I'm locked out"" type, which are usually closed as duplicates to Can not unlock my Android device as have no internet connection?. Formerly, that question was phrased ""Can not unlock my tablet..."". When I find such a (new) question and want to VTC it: how to find this ""master question""? Looking for ""Can not unlock my tablet"" makes it hard to find. It however turns out on top of the search when I type in the exact phrasing.
My point? Given a user really does a search before asking, he's unlikely to know the exact phrasing. But with more and more duplicates kept as pointers, chances to have one of them turning up on top of the search results are increasing. Opening that one then leads to the ""final point of interest"". In short words:"
367,"You could find one of their posts and leave an ""@name"" comment for them on their post. This should then appear as a notification for them next time they're on the site, but this isn't a forum or a chatroom, so that should be used sparingly. Perhaps that could be used to invite them to the Android room on  where you can actually have a real talk, and possibly swap enough contact details that you could then have a private conversation."
820,"5 questions isn't much to go by statistically, besides that 2 of the unanswered ones are from shortly before Christmas and the other from yesterday.  Two of them seem fairly obscure as well, so the whole I wouldn't be surprised.  Feel free to edit the older ones (ideally improving them) to bump them to the top of the Active list. Our unanswered question rate is 15% with SO at 19%. I would have expected it to be higher than SO (we do get a lot of obscure questions), but I would agree it does seem a bit high regardless.  Our answer rate is not as high as it was during Beta, either. While I would say the site is ""active"", it's not perfect.  We discussed some of the site's issues before here.  If you have any ideas on how to address any of this, please share them."
