2232,"I don't know if there is general SE guidance on this, but I would say yes &mdash; clear cut cases seem like a good place for flags.  This site is not at the point where moderators need to heavily triage flags, as yet.  That said, I also go fully through most queues regularly, so a flag is not strictly necessary."
1488,"From what I've seen of questions asked by developers having issue with the Play Store, most of the questions would be closed in any event, simply because (I'll see if I can dig up some examples, but it'll take time.) Further, would any of these questions have people who could answer them? We only have a few developers here; I expect most questions will remain neglected and unanswered. Granted, this last is a chicken-and-egg problem, but would developers come here and happily co-exist with Android users?  And what about the slippery-slope issue of, ""Well, you let me ask about Play Store Analytics for my app. Why won't you let me ask coding questions? All the developers are here anyway..."" I think, were we to change our policy, we'd end up with something like what we have with rooting/modding questions. Yes, we have a bunch, and some have good answers, but the really good information is elsewhere, and we're mostly just a gateway to that information. Only worse."
675,"The Android Guys are. The screen shot is obviously from today, as are a good number of the sample questions they suggest. I just wish they'd sorted questions by votes to showcase our ""best of"" stuff."
300,"This is a fine set of guidelines. I suspect only very lightweight development topics, those that can be answered by an android enthusiast and not necessarily an android programmer should be kept here. That said, I am sure there is overlap in audiences, but let's keep the site goals in mind."
118,"We should email a some of the big Android Blogs an let them know about Android.SE, invite them to join and share their expertise and encourage them to share it as a resource to their readers.  I was going to just do it but maybe we should discuss a game plan. These are the android sites I frequent:"
1331,"This question has been asked multiple times at Meta Stack Overflow for a variety of projects/tools/libraries. (Here's probably the definitive question and answer: Is it okay to use Stack Overflow as the support forum for a product or project? ) Part of the problem is that there's a good chunk of ""support"" that falls outside of the realm of what Android Stack Exchange is about. Feature requests, for instance. Bug reports is another. Those questions, should they get asked here, will be ruthlessly downvoted, closed, and deleted. That's not the sort of experience you want your users to have. That said, I think it's a good idea for you to let your users know that you actively monitor the tag for your app(s) here. Just don't try to make this the ""official support forum"" for it."
2089,"I too think it is pretty much off-topic. Example 1: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one should I buy? We simply can't know the expectations and parameters of choice of any person. Example 2: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one is
better? Since utility of a good is not quantifiable, the answers are going to be pretty much subjective and opinion-based. Example 3: I want a phone with following specs: blablabla Can you guys suggest any? There are websites that find phones with the desired specs already."
24,Sounds like a good idea to me.
619,Sounds like a good idea to me. Have at it!
1068,Sounds good. I like the proposal.
