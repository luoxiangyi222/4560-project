313,"I can type into the search box, but I can't seem to get it to submit. When I click the Enter or OK buttons it just seems to change focus to another field. Similarly, I can't figure out how to close the messaging bar at the top of the screen. I can't scroll far enough to the right to close it. Not sure if it matters, but this is with a Motorola Flipside running 2.1."
1192," Liam W answered:  Comments - to notify that user to try and improve. If I understand what they are on about, the edit button. If after a while, nothing has changed, the close or delete button.  Flow answered:  Edit, downvote or flag. More or less in that order  Suraj Bajaj answered:  Depends. If poorly written, edit button would be my first choice. If argumentative, I would prefer leaving a comment. Down vote would always be my last choice. I would rather try to improve (and ask the author to improve), than just down voting. However, last choice is still a choice! :)"
341,"I much prefer a sans font, so I think that's a good choice. As for badges/tags, it'd by nice if they were similar to the standard buttons. A smaller version of  with text might serve for badges. Change the color in the center for bronze/silver/gold. The buttons here  are definitely viable for both. They gray/silver could be for normal tags, the yellow for featured tags. How about this?  It's actually an arm from the Android mascot. Perhaps not as in-your-face green, but the radius of the curve evokes Android."
2187,"A duplicate answer is an answer that does not add any information not alerady in an older answer. Note that the above text is only an example, but you need to provide the link to the original answer, if you want quicker mod action and/or don't want mods to search for a possibly long time to find the original answer because they have to do other things too and you are uselessly delaying them with that. At the bottom of every answer, just above the comment section, there are at least these 3 buttons: ""share"", ""edit"" and ""flag"" (if this isn't there you couldn't flag in the first place.) Then, go to the duplicate answer and do step 5 (or 5.2, if you managed to keep the flag window open all that time). A duplicate answer is a duplicate, no matter when it is posted. It just needs to be posted at least 1 second later than the original one in order to be recognizable as a duplicate."
485,"You make a good point. I have updated the button styling a bit, both on the main site and on Meta. For the main site, I made the button text green, and for Meta they're much darker now.  The changes will be in the next deployment."
625,"This bug was the result of some related back-end changes, which will be corrected in the next build.  Kinda glad this broke, an even earlier change could be made even faster/cheaper for the wiki-redirect case...and now is."
118,"We should email a some of the big Android Blogs an let them know about Android.SE, invite them to join and share their expertise and encourage them to share it as a resource to their readers.  I was going to just do it but maybe we should discuss a game plan. These are the android sites I frequent:"
1272,"I usually prefer wi-fi. But seeing that most people prefer WiFi, I will consider this in my next edits.  Off-topic, I don't edits just to change the wi-fi text only. I also consider if the sentences can be rephrased, or added with punctuations for easier readability."
766," Al Everett answered: Heck no. That's a breach of trust.  Matthew Read answered: Absolutely not.  If the information wasn't provided in the public profile or provided directly by the person to me, then it's private.  It should only be used if necessary in the course of moderation duties and never exposed beyond the user, other mods, and the team within the appropriate contexts.  eldarerathis answered: No, I wouldn't feel at all right about doing that. I'd only ever consider contacting someone if it was through some kind of information they had chosen to make public.  Bryan Denny answered: No, I would say that is ""creepy."" If they didn't publicly share the info, then I have no reason to try and contact them (other than the rare/exceptional sending a private message procedure)  Flow answered: No, thatâ€™s not for what the tool is meant to. Especially if  the data is not public visible. "
61,"Yes, I find QR links very useful, especially when there are no many barcode scanners around. However, There should be a standard for these ""Here is an App that will help"" posts, just so we aren't A) leaching images, B) not shutting out users who want to see the app without having to go to the market place. Below, I've listed the way I've been linking apps to answers, including how not to leach images (IMPORTANT) because we don't want to get in trouble, now do we? For QR images, I've been using the following method: 1) Find the app on (marketplace e.g. AppBrain) you want to share
 2) Find the QR Code button, and locate the QR code.
 3) Copy the URL of the QR code
 The URL is
 Which is basically  If you use the Image upload tool on the post answer, you can use the image URL to reupload the image to imgur.com
 That way, you get the right QR code, generated from a reliable source, and you don't steal bandwidth. 4) MAKE SURE YOU HREF LINK TO APPBRAIN AT THE SAME TIME
So annoying when you get a QR link, and no web reference to what it is (I'm not sure what other services use, I use AppBrain for a lot of my stuff, but if you know the marketplace URL, just go from step 3 and hardcode the charts.api link yourself) (Freehand circles)"
