778,"It looked like service was actually mostly used to refer to network issues, i.e., problems with ""phone service"".  I replaced it with connectivity in most places, services where applicable.  I think it's probably best to let service die out rather than merge with something else.  If it comes up again we should probably rename it to phone-service or something clearer."
2395,"If you have a better answer, post it. Explain what should and should not be done, and why. Downvote any wrong answers you see. Comment on their flaws when applicable. But don't try to change someone else's answer to say what they did not intend to say. Respect the original author even while disagreeing with them.  Contrary to your claim, there are many dangerously wrong answers on other sites, such as Stack Overflow. Following someone's wrong advice regarding information security can be much worse than destroying a phone. Those answers still exist. When there's is a dangerous misconception around, it's better for it to be voiced and refuted than never be voiced."
1148,"I've re-opened it.  I don't think one person verifying that they can see the buttons is enough to say that no one else will be unable to see them, like you.  I can't think of any reason why this would be happening to you and only you, so I think it passes the ""potentially useful to others"" metric. The nature of the question obviously changed due to the comments, however &mdash; it's some combination of your account/location/environment/app version/etc. and the particular apps rather than something about the particular apps that affects everyone.  I've edited it as such, please make sure to do such editing yourself when possible.  Secondly the question would benefit from extra information, such as:"
393,"I think for that particular question it's okay. The issue doesn't appear to be device specific, so the steps JonnyP is suggesting should help both people. If Travis had opened a new question, we almost certainly would have closed it as a duplicate of this question. That's not to say that it's okay to hijack someone else's question, but that in this case I don't think it's out-of-bounds."
1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
1559,"Your initial post was way to offensive. I am considering to delete it all together and taking additional measures, but first I want say a few words. There is absolutely no need to insult anyone. A user voted on some of your questions, so what? Nothing happened, and even if something had happened: Everything within the Stackexchange network can be reverted. Users need to read the questions and answers before they comment. This
  kind of closing of questions and answers just discourages involvement.
  The onus can't be on the submitter to explain why his stuff is
  different when the judge, jury, and executioner was simply too lazy to
  read. Why is it a problem to explain why you think your questions aren't duplicates, if somebody else doesn't think so? What's wrong with a discussion to find a consensus? Besides, nothing has happened, there was no 'executioner' involved."
2165,"One factor nobody has mentioned yet: an answer that says, ""you have to modify the ROM to do it"" could well lead someone (the questioner, or someone else who sees the answer) who has never tried making ROMs to start doing it. Or it could lead to a ROM developer adding that feature to their ROM. Or, in this particular case, someone might see it and realise that a particular ROM already has that feature. I think those all sound like good outcomes. ROM developers don't just spring into existence fully formed: they're just users with problems who try to learn something to solve them. I'm generally quite happy with an answer that leads people into a non-end-user solution, as long as we don't start scaring people off."
1748,"I'm not totally against this idea, but it would often require the user to research something they may not have been prepared to.  Any barrier to posting has to be carefully considered so quality is balanced with ease of use, since the longer it takes the more likely the user is to go somewhere else.  It's also definitely not up to just the user to define how a tag will be used on the site, and we do have some guidelines and particular formats for types of tags."
41,"I would say yes. Certainly for built-in and Google applications. For more obscure application maybe not, but those are less likely to get answers anyways"
696,"This is great. Any way we can create a system message or do something else to nudge users to dig thru the old unanswered questions and submit them here? Or how about... can you sort old unanswered questions by view count (I can't) to see what garners interest today? I'd like to maybe nominate 10 or 15 old questions for this initiative &amp; attach a ""bounty"" -- answer a question, throw your name in the hat for a Kindle Fire. Also, I don't see why moderators can't be eligible here."
