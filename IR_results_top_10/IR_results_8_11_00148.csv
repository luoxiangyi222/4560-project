2372,"Don't forget doze-mode in your list :) We definitely should fix those wrongly tagged power-options – but for the remaining names also consider synonyms (unless there're good reasons for ""keeping things apart""): So I'd say a tag dedicated to (the different) power-saving-modes (including Stamina etc), as ""generic catch"" for those topics would be a good idea. Though we already have doze-mode: and apple is a fruit, but a fruit not necessarily an apple :) Still, at the moment I wouldn't go as far as to create a separate tag for each manufacturer's ""special mode"": Some manufacturers also offer their own battery saver modes. For example, Samsung offers an “Ultra Power Saving Mode,” HTC offers an “EXTREME Power Saving Mode,” and Sony offers a “STAMINA mode” and “Low battery mode.” (How-To Geek: How to Use and Configure Android’s “Battery Saver” Mode) TL;DR: If there are at least 5 questions you'd apply the power-savings-mode tag to, I'd say just do it "
1013,"It seems to me that the answer you refer to is trying to answer the question behind your question. It is, at least, an attempt to answer some aspect of your question. By and large, Moderators are going to be conservative about deleting answers; they'll only do so if it is an obvious non-answer. Frankly, I think your question is off-topic. Certainly it's not an Android-specific issue. All that considered, it's the community that decides. You've received an answer and you've commented that you don't think it is and your rationale. That's good. The community seems to not agree. Re-flagging in hopes of getting a Moderator to issue a different decision is a little disingenuous. (There's an obvious parallel to a child not getting the answer she wants from one parent and going to ask the other parent the same question.) That you've raised the issue here on Meta is fine, as any discussion that can help improve the site is welcome."
1360,Good catch. recovery is now a synonym of recovery-mode.
860,This if fine by me. Martin covers all the points I was going to say. Pass on over the good questions. :)
1917,"which newest questions are unanswered  which questions are put on hold  questions with a high bounty  There is simply no way to include every possible search combination as a UI filter, it would be insanely cluttered and completely unusable. If you want to search for a narrower subset of questions instead of a broad category, that's exactly what search is for and what it's good at.  A huge list of filters in the UI is just going to slow you down. You should take a look at  and familiarize yourself with the search operators you find most useful!"
2089,"I too think it is pretty much off-topic. Example 1: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one should I buy? We simply can't know the expectations and parameters of choice of any person. Example 2: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one is
better? Since utility of a good is not quantifiable, the answers are going to be pretty much subjective and opinion-based. Example 3: I want a phone with following specs: blablabla Can you guys suggest any? There are websites that find phones with the desired specs already."

29,"I think a lot of good points have already been made here but after taking a look at the existing questions, I really think people need to take a good hard look at this: Edit - I missed a few, and more just keep coming and coming... Guys, this is seriously awful.  We are just one day into the beta and out of 109 questions on the site, 22 of them (over 20%) are about which apps are ""good/bad/best"" - yikes! Worse, almost none of them are Community Wiki, so people are actually gaining rep for asking and answering the most mundane and subjective questions imaginable. I think this list very dramatically illustrates the problem with allowing these questions.  There's no end to them.  What's the best compass app?  What's the best flashlight app?  What's the best ukelele simulation app?  Gah! Is this what we're going to be, just a glorified review site?  Is it really that hard to just go to the market and read the reviews?  The Android developers have already built us this beautiful rating and review system that you can access right on your phone.  We don't need this fluff. Please, please, let's start closing these questions.  At the very least close them until we have moderators who can properly wikify them, but even then, I don't want to see people's 1-line recommendations taking up 20% of the site.  This is turning into a land grab with everybody wanting to own one of the big bad 500+ upvoted poll questions.  If we don't nip this in the bud, it's going to bite us hard later on. P.S. I'm not saying every question about an app is bad.  Here are two that are fine: In the first example, somebody is looking for a very specific app and has provided criteria to significantly narrow down the list of candidates.  In the second example, the author is asking for a comparison of two specific apps.  I see no problem with either of these. I just don't want to see two hundred ""Post your favourite [X] app"" polls by the time we hit public beta."
1298,"Sounds good to me, except for the case where a user wants to restore their phone to original stock. I feel that asking where to find the stock image is a good question, since stock won't change (while ROMs are constantly created/updated/abandoned)."
2187,"A duplicate answer is an answer that does not add any information not alerady in an older answer. Note that the above text is only an example, but you need to provide the link to the original answer, if you want quicker mod action and/or don't want mods to search for a possibly long time to find the original answer because they have to do other things too and you are uselessly delaying them with that. At the bottom of every answer, just above the comment section, there are at least these 3 buttons: ""share"", ""edit"" and ""flag"" (if this isn't there you couldn't flag in the first place.) Then, go to the duplicate answer and do step 5 (or 5.2, if you managed to keep the flag window open all that time). A duplicate answer is a duplicate, no matter when it is posted. It just needs to be posted at least 1 second later than the original one in order to be recognizable as a duplicate."
