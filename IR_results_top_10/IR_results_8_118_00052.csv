1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
622,"Frankly, I think questions like this should be closed as ""too localized"", but I'm afraid we're going to keep getting them. They're way too localized. Even a question like ""what's new in Android 4.0?"" would be marginal (I'd point them to Wikipedia, I look up what's new in each Google Chrome release on Wikipedia for example). An 2.3.x release on a specific phone model (I'm assuming vendors tweak each release?) is incredibly localized and trivial."
860,This if fine by me. Martin covers all the points I was going to say. Pass on over the good questions. :)
598,"Good point, I could see the point with an ""External GPS"" tag, but I think at this point we can safely assume that any question about GPS refers to the internal GPS unless otherwise specified. Have had a look through the only three questions that were tagged ""internal gps"" and couldn't see anything on them that required the distinction. Have removed the ""internal gps"" tag from them all."
29,"I think a lot of good points have already been made here but after taking a look at the existing questions, I really think people need to take a good hard look at this: Edit - I missed a few, and more just keep coming and coming... Guys, this is seriously awful.  We are just one day into the beta and out of 109 questions on the site, 22 of them (over 20%) are about which apps are ""good/bad/best"" - yikes! Worse, almost none of them are Community Wiki, so people are actually gaining rep for asking and answering the most mundane and subjective questions imaginable. I think this list very dramatically illustrates the problem with allowing these questions.  There's no end to them.  What's the best compass app?  What's the best flashlight app?  What's the best ukelele simulation app?  Gah! Is this what we're going to be, just a glorified review site?  Is it really that hard to just go to the market and read the reviews?  The Android developers have already built us this beautiful rating and review system that you can access right on your phone.  We don't need this fluff. Please, please, let's start closing these questions.  At the very least close them until we have moderators who can properly wikify them, but even then, I don't want to see people's 1-line recommendations taking up 20% of the site.  This is turning into a land grab with everybody wanting to own one of the big bad 500+ upvoted poll questions.  If we don't nip this in the bud, it's going to bite us hard later on. P.S. I'm not saying every question about an app is bad.  Here are two that are fine: In the first example, somebody is looking for a very specific app and has provided criteria to significantly narrow down the list of candidates.  In the second example, the author is asking for a comparison of two specific apps.  I see no problem with either of these. I just don't want to see two hundred ""Post your favourite [X] app"" polls by the time we hit public beta."
856,"Thanks alot Lauren.
I have sent you an email about my contact information. I don't know exactly how you are going to do this? Do you have the Kindle Fire at home, or are you going to order it? Because it can't be ordered from Amazon to Denmark. But it can be sent with the normal air mail directly to me.  But again thanks alot, and looking forward to be an active member on this lovely website :D"
1682,"The +100 rep association bonus is not counted in the protection algorithm. The post notice states (emphasis added): To answer it, you must have earned at least 10 reputation on this site. and the ""on this site"" part is actually quite literal, though not entirely clear. Therefore, looking at your rep history, you've got +100 for the association bonus and +5 for an upvote on one of your questions. That nets you 5 rep from your activities on this site, which is still shy of the 10 needed. There is also a more detailed explanation of the ""protected"" status on Meta Stack Exchange, for reference. In this specific case, the view count of the question is pretty low, so I'm going to remove the protection. It looks like it was applied because it picked up a bunch of non-answers within the first 24 hours, but then the views petered off after that."
1016,"This is a new and interesting feature that allows users to spend less effort while doing their part to this community network. The new feature, as any other feature comes with potential bad habits that one may get caught in without noticing. Some that I've noticed across SE are: Clicker happy Experienced users or new users all get involved in such a way that may forget about the real purpose of the review area. Take you time, analyze what you are reviewing: Is there an actual “accept ALL the suggested edits” problem? The usage for competition One interesting part of the new review is that we are able to view who's the top reviewer, what position are we in, and even compare decisions by looking at the review history.  This serves the purpose of providing users a way to improve themselves and refrain from committing mistakes, by learning with others. It is not the Olympic Games, there's no fat payment for the first place, so, don't go voting just because! Vote and review always with the community shirt on. Exaggerated point of view One may get addicted, and as any addiction, there are side effects. If you're tired of seeing what you consider bad answers or bad questions, take a break from review, use the chat to exchange ideas, post a question at META to clarify you point of view. Remember the famous: Could we please be a bit nicer to new users? Don't spend your precious time reviewing just to feel tired and saturated. I'm answering this as to illustrate some of the frequent problems I see on the several SE sites, being discussed on META, and even some that I've personally experienced and/or have been confronted by. Feel free to improve it."
2214,"Actually, though the animation is done by an event listener (as Matthew pointed out), there's no userscript needed. You can easily fool the javascript part by setting the animation duration to 0s in CSS: That did it for me at least."
1275,"One of the points explained in How does accept rate work? appears to apply here: The question in question is not old enough to be counted toward your accept rate yet - it's less than an hour old. In addition, even if the question was 3 days old, that answer is relatively new. Another relevant point from the above linked answer: So this looks like it's status-bydesign."
