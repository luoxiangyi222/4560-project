1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
1512,"I think what happened here is that there was already a suggested edit pending on that post when you reviewed it. The timeline looks like (all UTC): During that window between 18:57 and 19:12, you would be unable to suggest an edit on that post since there is already one awaiting review. Thus, when you tried to make some corrections to the post in the review queue, it returned an error. Therefore, I'd say the main problem here is that the text of the error message is very poor. If it had said something more like: You may not currently suggest an edit to this post because one is already pending. ...then it would have more accurately captured the situation."
1326,"The thing with ""too minor"" edits is a good point. AFAIK the background of this restriction is to prevent &lt;2000 rep users from gaming the system by making a lot of small and easy edits that don't completely fix a post. Edits should fix all issues of a post. Not just the minor ones. But if there were only minor ones that needed to be fixed and got fixed with the suggested edit then I tend to approve the edit."
2291,"Looks like someone came to the rescue. As said by @bmdixon in comments,  the suggested edits require two reviewers approval. After going over links of suggested edits, I managed to grab the link of the faulty approved edit and noticed, that at the tine it was not awarded but was waiting for another review.    So if one reviewer approves and the other rejects, a third reviwer is needed to either approve or reject accordingly depending on the post.   Lesson learned: I have to be thorough in reviewing posts and prevent suggested edits that harm post or deviate intended meaning of post from being awarded to users, to ensure that quality is preserved on the site and high levels of reviewing are also maintained. It tends out for now no one is getting banned for approving bad suggested edits this time but it is a wake up call :)"
39,"I totally thought the same thing about the 'android-app' tag being redundant. We should choose which one is the ""authoritative"" tag and edit all the questions to use that one.  I vote we use ""applications"". (Is there a way to blacklist tags?)"
2383,"We don't have review audits on this site. While the second one does look like the random garbage of an autogenerated edit for an audit, it's a real edit someone suggested. We do occasionally get rubbish edits like this, and more often spam edits like the first one you linked. Like flagging posts as spam, rejecting edits as ""spam or vandalism"" feeds the suggester's info (IP address etc.) into the anti-spam system, making it harder for them to come back and keep wasting our time with spam edits."
2358,"Many common link-shorteners are already blocked by the site because of the problems that they pose. As a general rule, editing the post to replace the shortened links with regular ones is the right way to go, and the same applies with ad-based shorteners. If you feel a specific user is especially overbearing with the links then leaving a comment may not be a bad idea. Flagging one of their posts for the mod team to look at is also a reasonable option, particularly if you find the links to be of questionable usefulness and more for the purpose of driving traffic through the link service."
1516,"This is quite possibly my fault (though the system should probably handle it better). At the end of last week How do you link to applications in the Android market? came up in my Close Votes queue as a dupe of How to post a link to an android market app? but after looking at the two questions, it was obvious that one had old, out-of-date and (now-)incorrect answers (one answer was by me) whereas the other one had answers that are current and correct. In my opinion the Close As Dupe vote had been cast on the wrong question (based on which one had the currently good answers) so I ""Leave Open"" voted the one and I submitted the first VtC on the other. Having explained what I did though, the system really should show what's going on in a clearer manner, and handle the situation where one is Closed as a Dupe while the other is still in the vote to close phase."
820,"5 questions isn't much to go by statistically, besides that 2 of the unanswered ones are from shortly before Christmas and the other from yesterday.  Two of them seem fairly obscure as well, so the whole I wouldn't be surprised.  Feel free to edit the older ones (ideally improving them) to bump them to the top of the Active list. Our unanswered question rate is 15% with SO at 19%. I would have expected it to be higher than SO (we do get a lot of obscure questions), but I would agree it does seem a bit high regardless.  Our answer rate is not as high as it was during Beta, either. While I would say the site is ""active"", it's not perfect.  We discussed some of the site's issues before here.  If you have any ideas on how to address any of this, please share them."
404,"Al is correct, the device specific tags are getting a little out of hand but I'm going to have to agree with Amanda and Matthew Read on this one.  I think that it is sufficiently device specific to warrant a device specific tag.  I think it's important to consider that tags are not necessarily mutually exclusive.  I restored the tag but shouldn't it be tagged ""htc-g1"" instead of ""tmobile-g1""?  I thought the practice was ""manufacturer-model"" not ""carrier-model""."
