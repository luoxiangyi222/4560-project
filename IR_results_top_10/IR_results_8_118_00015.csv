1270,"The other could be deleted if totally unanswered, but if it would be useful to others then it's best to keep it and provide an answer.  If the answer's long I usually summarize and link it (when I've done this sort of thing with my own answers), otherwise I just copy it outright. If you're worried about rep I would say that you deserve credit if you answer B with something copied from A.  We all learn things somewhere, it doesn't matter if it was on this SE or not; spreading knowledge to help other users is exactly what we want you to do."
1116,"Since the text was copied verbatim from the source, I would have used the ""quote"" feature. Perhaps that's just me, though. Answers in which the only useful information can be found at the end of a link aren't really answers. Links to the author's blog/site are particularly self-serving and ""spammy"". So, if there is good information, those answers should be edited to include that information. Otherwise they should be flagged as ""not an answer"" and/or ""it is spam"" and deleted. Generally speaking, however, information from third-party sources should not be copied verbatim. If memory serves, there is even a Moderator tool to warn users and one of the options is to warn copiers. Yes, this is in order to honor copyright (where it applies) and fairness (where it doesn't). In this particular case, the author of the post is self-identified as the owner of the blog being copied. How does one plagiarize oneself? Part of the purpose of copyright is to keep other people from taking credit for your work. In this case, the person who wrote the original is getting credit for writing it. Copyright is being respected. If the author has a problem with his work being used in this way, as the original author of the post he can very quickly and easily edit it out or delete his question. In this particular case I think the right thing was done. A not-useful answer was turned into a very useful one, and the original author of the information was given credit. Now, when dealing with someone posting verbatim information from a third-party site that they didn't write, well, that's pretty clearly a no-no."
2024,"Stack Exchange is very community-focused, so don't worry that you can't personally verify an answer.  Other users will vote/comment as they see fit and any useful information should float to the top. If the question itself is localized to a particular situation that others won't encounter, or to software that is no longer available, etc. then the question should probably be closed.  You could flag it with a custom reason (explaining this) if that is the case. In the case of the specific question Firelord linked, the new answers don't seem very good so I have protected the question; however, it does seem like it will be relevant to future users so I'm not going to close it."
1597,"Scripts can have accounts too. It would be easy for a spammer or other malicious user to sign in and then give control to his script. Having the possibility of a CAPTCHA for signed-in users prevents this attack. The system has a few ways to guess whether particular activity is from a genuine user. Full details aren't available to us end-users, because that would make the system too easy for attackers to defeat. One common way to make the check go wrong is to leave a page open for a long time before submitting the form; for example, you start to answer a question, then get interrupted, go to lunch, come back an hour later, finish answering the question, and then get the CAPTCHA when you try to post your answer. This is because of a token in the page that expires after some time."
2036,"I wouldn't say ""nothing relevant in common"" as Matthew put it (especially with MTK, which has its specifics). But what I agree with: This site is for end-users, and the majority of end-users probably has no clue whether their device features a mt6582 or rk3066 chip – and if they do, they can specify such in the question's text. A tag is not very useful if ignored by the majority even if it would fit – so I agree with Matthew we don't want/need those on an end-user site (it would look different if we were a techie-centric site, sure)."
2035,"What is the actual use in grouping phones by chipset?  This site is for end-users, there is going to be virtually nothing relevant in common between two phones from different manufacturers than both happen to include MediaTek chips."
1051,"It is a question with a definite, non-subjective answer (as long as you just say what has changed and how, and stay away from saying if it's an actual improvement or now). However it's also very localized in time. The answer is only ever going to be useful for someone with your make/model and firmware version. The number of people with that combination is going to shrink to none over time as people pick up and apply the update. I think that this is probably something that would need to be taken on a question by question basis, and probably only for very major updates (eg 2.3 -> 4), or updates that would affect a lot of devices in the same way (eg a TouchWiz or Sense UI update)."
1210,"When you see a post here on meta titled ""2012 Community Moderator Election Results"" you'll be able to read it and know what the results were. That'll usually happen somewhere between 10 minutes and 24 hours after the election ends.  Of course, someone will probably post the results in chat between 10 and 24 seconds after the election ends. But if that's still not quick enough for you, you can download the OpenSTV software and election data and run it yourself (both will be linked to on the election page immediately after the election ends). How long that takes is up to you. "
369,"Now that the Market has launched as a website explicitly available to both phones and PCs, where the  link will take you to the webpage on a PC, or straight into the relevant page in the Market app on a phone, this probably isn't necessary any more. See also QR Code generator"
941,"I've earned both badges over on Stack Overflow, and they did not exist until after I had already exceeded the 3000 rep level and had VTC privileges. There are still a lot of other ways that flags are important, though, and which contribute to your helpful flag count: Also, if you come across a paticularly old post that you really think should be closed (but is unlikely to receive much traffic), I would consider flagging it with the ""Other"" reason after you have cast a close vote, then briefly explaining your reasoning. Although there are tools available to 10k+ members and mods that show recent close votes, it's easy to neglect them, whereas flags are very prominent. That's probably not going to get you into Deputy/Marshal territory with any kind of speed, though."
