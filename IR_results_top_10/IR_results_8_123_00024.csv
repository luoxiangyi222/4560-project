1973,"After discussing with two to three people and posting this type of question, I found that  No one has any objection on these type of question.  Since it is not possible for all to know about the file standard of android these type of questions will be helpful for people like me. I wanted to know where the saved wifi-passwords are stored and I got an answer from this SE site and therefore I wanted to know about the other files stores in same directory as that of the file which contained the saved wifi passwords.  So this type of questions can be helpful this way. Best Regards, Jasser"
1157,"I have nominated myself, so I think I should provide an answer. I believe that a Diamond Moderator should be active, as well as there. They would need to respond quickly to flags - so they can be dealt with. They would also need to have a good rep - so that people can see that they are trustworthy, as well as having been a member for a good while. I believe that a diamond moderator should always shed some light on their decisions - I know this is hardly possible, but I believe that they should comment, and help new members follow the site rules, and stay on topic. I know this has been quick - but this is what I believe."
362,"For normal users, no.  You cannot directly contact the user unless they provide the information freely on their profile. If there is an issue with another user, feel free to let any of us moderators know."
1202," Liam W answered:  Very good question. I would suggest to them that they continue their answering, but ensure they think about their comments before they post them. I would recommend that as a valued contributor (to answers), they should know the rules. I would ask them to follow them, and then I may have to resort to drastic measures (times suspensions etc).  Flow answered:  Depends on the type of comments he leaves. I never encountered that case on AN.SX. But if I agree with the comments, which is likely if it's a big amount of flags, I would contact him and ask him to stop that behaviour. I like the friendly and polite tone on SX and would like to keep it that way.  Suraj Bajaj answered:  Well, wherever I find any such comment I will act on it. Ask them to be careful and be friendly with users. Everyone's opinion matters but it has to be put in the right way. It hardly matters how much rep you have if you don't know how to behave."
896,"Well, you know, there are such things as on-topic questions that no one can answer. Or, more accurately, the person who can answer just hasn't visited the site. A well-written question with the right keywords will certainly draw websearch traffic, so it's only a matter of time until we get an answer (we hope). On the other hand, dozens of ""how do I install OS (x) on device (y)"" won't be helpful. A canonical question to trap them all would be good."
321,"I'm not commenting on the up/down vote as much as the assertion that several people have made that it's off-topic.  It very well may not be an Android specific question when you know the answer but I think it's clear by the way he phrased it, that he didn't know that it's not Android specific.  Personally, I think it's sufficiently related to the use of Android phones not to warrant ""Off-topic"" votes, especially when it's clear that the OP thinks it may be Android specific."
1160,"The only flags that need to be responded to quickly are spam, threats, and those where people have included personally identifiable information. All others can wait until they're gotten too. A Diamond should also have a light touch. An awful lot of things that are flagged shouldn't be. A Diamond should be fair, firm, and consistent. A Diamond should have a sense of humor, not take themselves too seriously, and recognize when they're not mentally well-equipped to deal with a situation. A Diamond should be in constant contact with the other Diamonds. Not necessarily to ensure consensus on every decision (although consensus is important) but so that they all know what's going on and to provide support where needed. A Diamond should expect to answer fewer questions and to spend a little time on the site every day, several times a day."
2586,"Update: the account has been merged successfully. As a moderator, I noticed the 2 attempts of account merging, but we don't really know what is wrong with it. Only Community Managers (Stack Exchange employees) can investigate the issue further and merge the account. Assuming that you have followed the procedure from the ""Contact Us"" form but failed, there is nothing else you have to do. However, we will try to have contacted the Community Team regarding this issue. They should be able to merge manually after verifying both accounts. Please wait patiently until then."
856,"Thanks alot Lauren.
I have sent you an email about my contact information. I don't know exactly how you are going to do this? Do you have the Kindle Fire at home, or are you going to order it? Because it can't be ordered from Amazon to Denmark. But it can be sent with the normal air mail directly to me.  But again thanks alot, and looking forward to be an active member on this lovely website :D"
517,I do not know the ins-and-outs of the automated quality filters that are in place. I suspect that the lack of capital letters might be one of the triggers. You don't mention the title you were trying to use; if it was identical to your question text that would be an easy filter to put into place. You would do well to try some of the suggestions in the answers to the two questions eldarerathis linked to.
