2035,"What is the actual use in grouping phones by chipset?  This site is for end-users, there is going to be virtually nothing relevant in common between two phones from different manufacturers than both happen to include MediaTek chips."
1210,"When you see a post here on meta titled ""2012 Community Moderator Election Results"" you'll be able to read it and know what the results were. That'll usually happen somewhere between 10 minutes and 24 hours after the election ends.  Of course, someone will probably post the results in chat between 10 and 24 seconds after the election ends. But if that's still not quick enough for you, you can download the OpenSTV software and election data and run it yourself (both will be linked to on the election page immediately after the election ends). How long that takes is up to you. "
485,"You make a good point. I have updated the button styling a bit, both on the main site and on Meta. For the main site, I made the button text green, and for Meta they're much darker now.  The changes will be in the next deployment."
625,"This bug was the result of some related back-end changes, which will be corrected in the next build.  Kinda glad this broke, an even earlier change could be made even faster/cheaper for the wiki-redirect case...and now is."
2225,"This site is for Android users.  As a rule of thumb, do not ask any question where the question does not come from the perspective of an end user doing end user things. Marketing and charging money are obviously related, but are distinct concepts; you can do one without the other.  So whether your app is free is not relevant, and asking for feedback absolutely counts as ""market research"". As Eldarerathis notes, we also do not accept open-ended polling or anything of that kind.  Questions should be specific and should require answers that can be determined to be correct or not &mdash; not just an opinion, like feedback."
264,"I definitely see now why it makes sense not to do this kind of tagging -- clicking the tag will show you all the questions where the user has Device X, when you really want to see all the questions about Device X. That said, many questions need device and OS info, and the tags are a convenient place to put it, for consistency reasons.  The information is always in the same place and clearly distinct from the question, so the potential answerer doesn't have to search the question for it (or remember it all as they read the question). I think the optimal solution would be to have separate fields for device and OS version that the asker could fill in if it's relevant.  The info could be shown in a separate box or something at the end of the question.  I'm not sure how much work this would be for the SE people or if it's desirable to modify this site / some sites this way, since it's clearly not applicable across the board.  Perhaps instead the FAQ could show a standard template that people should insert at the end of their question, something like:"
941,"I've earned both badges over on Stack Overflow, and they did not exist until after I had already exceeded the 3000 rep level and had VTC privileges. There are still a lot of other ways that flags are important, though, and which contribute to your helpful flag count: Also, if you come across a paticularly old post that you really think should be closed (but is unlikely to receive much traffic), I would consider flagging it with the ""Other"" reason after you have cast a close vote, then briefly explaining your reasoning. Although there are tools available to 10k+ members and mods that show recent close votes, it's easy to neglect them, whereas flags are very prominent. That's probably not going to get you into Deputy/Marshal territory with any kind of speed, though."
2299,"From my point of view, that very much depends on the intention. As you already pointed out in your question, there are many occasions where those tools are of benefit to the end user and thus should be on-topic. Examples include, but are not limited to: Others are rather in the scope of development and hence should be off-topic. Again, some non-exclusive examples: Summed up: if those questions target end-users, even power-users, they should be on-topic. If they (primarily) target development, they are off-topic. That was as we've always dealt with it, and IMHO we should continue doing so."
2089,"I too think it is pretty much off-topic. Example 1: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one should I buy? We simply can't know the expectations and parameters of choice of any person. Example 2: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one is
better? Since utility of a good is not quantifiable, the answers are going to be pretty much subjective and opinion-based. Example 3: I want a phone with following specs: blablabla Can you guys suggest any? There are websites that find phones with the desired specs already."
1618,"Regarding some of your specific examples: This seems like a bug rather than a ""real"" Android issue - Google Nexus 7 not recognized via USB I don't really see why that's a problem. People sometimes encounter bugs when using Android. Trying to find a workaround for a bug (if that is the case) is a perfectly reasonable problem to want to solve. How is that not a ""real"" Android issue? What would be your definition of a ""real"" Android issue if not an issue you encountered while trying to use Android? Did this break the rules? - What's the risk of installing Cyanogen Mod on unsupported phone? Do you have a specific reason why you think this question is off-topic? What about it is not related to using Android? This seems like a reasonable question for someone unfamiliar with Android/CyanogenMod to ask before they dive in and get themselves stuck in a bad situation. Too Localized? - How to connect your Nexus phone to a VGA projector? I suppose I could see this being kind of a niche question, but I don't think I'd go so far as to say that it's ""too localized"". That close reason doesn't actually exist anymore as it is, but when it did exist it was generally intended for problems that were only reproducible in the environment of the OP, or questions that were (or would be) rendered obsolete quickly over time. On Stack Overflow a common use was for questions where the error was a typo. Anecdotally, I had my boss come ask me how to do exactly what this question describes before going to a meeting once (he needed to demo an app for some potential clients). Now, regarding the general quality of the site: yes, we have over the course of this site's existence had a persistent problem with low quality questions, in my opinion. I think part of the problem is that there are a lot of questions that people want to ask that just don't fit on SE sites, which we have chosen not to accept (""Recommend a phone for me"", ""Help me find an app"", etc). There's not a whole lot we can do about these other than to point people to resources that will be able to (possibly) help them, like forums and such. We also regularly get questions that are just not answerable because they are too vague, usually with regards to bugs or other problems. ""My messaging app is force closing. Help me?"" is not descriptive enough for us to be helpful, for example. However, I would say that every site ultimately ends up with questions like this, particularly ones focused on end users (though, Stack Overflow certainly gets plenty of dev questions that are simply remarkably poor). Again, we just have to be diligent in keeping the site clean of these questions, and trying to guide the askers into posting more detailed questions. In sum, I'm not really sure what the end goal of your post is, honestly. I personally don't find the questions you list to be particularly ""fuzzy"" in terms of their appropriateness, and you haven't really provided specific portions of the on/off-topic guidelines that you think need to be tightened. This makes it kind of difficult (for me, at least) to really provide much in the way of meaningful discussion on the perceived issue. When you suggest: Should the rules be made more clear?  ...then I would recommend that you point out specifically the parts that you find unclear so that we can discuss them. Alternatively, perhaps you could explain what you think the appropriate topics of our site should be, and why. That would at least give us somewhere to start, but definitely do explain clearly the ""why"" so that we can accurately evaluate the merits of your stance."
