848,"There is so much text here, so I will keep it short: I had the same thought. Tag based promotion just doesn't work well on AN.SX. IMHO the best promotion is purely reputation based, with a slight addition. Something like: or just Where winners will be randomly chosen between the eligible users. Maybe this will also attract more users to edit the tag wiki to earn the rep."
846,"As a new user i know i don't have something to say.
But personally i had never heard of this site before Android Guys wrote an article about your competition, and it was perfect because i had a question which i have looked for in the past month and haven't found any answers too. And suddenly i had a chance to both get a answer on my question and a chance to win a tablet. It was a win win for me, and since i made my user here, i have tried to help a couple of users, and i am pretty sure i will stick here for a good while, because i like the way the site is build and how it is working. So even though i'm a new user, and don't have anything to say, then you should know that the audio competition worked on me :) [off topic]BTW: how do you run this site, there aren't any commercials on the site. Where do you get the money to run the server and buy the prices in the competitions? [/off topic] "
1906,"Overall I like the new theme. Feels much fresher. A couple of things I'd like to mention: status-completed Adding images to posts doesn't seem to be working for me now. The transparent gray overlay appears on top of the modal. Trying to click the dialog instead causes a click on the transparent layer, which dismisses the dialog. This is Chrome 41, Windows 7. The below images were added by editing a post on a different site and copying the links over here.  status-completed The icon in the SE menu is different from the favicon. Is there a plan to make these the same? I like the favicon much better, personally:  Speaking of icons, the one in the header logo on the main site is very faint. I actually like it better in green, because right now you can barely see it due to the lack of contrast. I understand if this may have been a deliberate choice, but I personally think it looks odd. Excuse my poor Paint.NET skills on this one, but here's a kind of general comparison.

2451,"I was the one who declined the flag, and eldarerathis's explanation is spot-on. I was having a clear-out of old flags - mostly, ones which we've all looked at but nobody was especially keen to delete. Without the context of the other answer, it just looks like a one-line answer that's low-quality but not very low quality. I suspect if this answer had been reviewed in the ""low quality posts"" queue, the outcome would have been the same, because you don't get to see other answers in the queue either. As Izzy says, if the reason for the flag is not clear by looking at the post itself, it's better to use a custom ""in need of moderator attention"" flag. That applies to duplicate answers like this, spam flags where it's not obvious why the post is spam, and some other cases. Another option is to add a comment to the answer before flagging it. Comments are visible in the flag and review queues, so if you explain the issue to the person who posted, we'll see it too. Just remember to be nice in that case, because your comment will be visible to everyone. With an answer like this one, you could comment something like, ""Are you trying to reply to so-and-so's answer by copying the text of it? Answers don't work like that on this site. If an answer works for you, vote it up so that other visitors can see it's good."" Then if you flag, it's obvious to whoever handles the flag (whether a moderator or anyone in the review queue) that you think the answer is a copy, and we can check it out."
2383,"We don't have review audits on this site. While the second one does look like the random garbage of an autogenerated edit for an audit, it's a real edit someone suggested. We do occasionally get rubbish edits like this, and more often spam edits like the first one you linked. Like flagging posts as spam, rejecting edits as ""spam or vandalism"" feeds the suggester's info (IP address etc.) into the anti-spam system, making it harder for them to come back and keep wasting our time with spam edits."
356,"This is very similar to a shopping recommendation and much of the same advice applies.  Beyond that, consider: you have created an ""infinite list of X"" question. Surely there is (probably) an Android equivalent for every single iPhone app? the equivalents, even if valid now, may change over time; apps change over time. The value of this list will be highly limited as it ages. Perhaps if you had specific things you were looking for Android equivalents to on iPhone -- like the built in default applications. But scoping it to ""any app that can ever be, or will ever be"" just doesn't work."
212,"The search engine answer seems the most likely. I know that when I've done a quick Google on answers for some of the slightly obscure questions here, the question itself often shows up in the top 5 Google results. Also, have a look at the questions with the most views, like the Galaxy S GPS problems one. These have thousands of views, and lots of replies from users with just one rep point, that smacks of people who've just found the page through a search engine when they're trying to find the solution to a problem they're having, but aren't sticking around and using the rest of the site."
608,"On the one hand I would prefer one site per answer so that we can vote
  on them individually and the good ones can rise to the top. This also
  makes sense since it's impossible to create a single definitive answer
  (some editors will find a particular site useful and others won't). Well, there are a few problems with these questions. Older answers will by default have more votes than newer answers, so for a question that's been open for months, you can't judge anything about the quality of a site/answer by the number of votes (unless they're into the negative, in which case it's a useless answer that misleads visitors who don't understand our voting and should probably be deleted). Once the answers overflow a page, though, you get into a situation
  where new answers never get seen or voted on, since few people go to
  the next page. I think the StackExchange team have tried to combat this effect over time. Unlike us, who've all been here long enough and clicked enough links to change all the defaults, new users coming to those pages will see a semi-random ordering of the answers (I think there's an activity bias to the randomness) so no two visitors should see the same ""first page"" of answers. I'd be tempted to say that if we keep these type of questions on the main site, then rather than treating them as a popularity contest between the answers, we do something more like the other ""community resource"" questions (like the ""when will my phone get updated"", ""how do I root"" type-stuff). So we make (almost) no obvious judgement on the quality of the sites and edit them all into one community wiki answer by category. (obviously the quality bar of each site will now be whether a user thinks they're good enough to nominate, after that all linked sites are treated equally)."
1314,"Unfortunately, I think there's simply not an ideal solution for situations like this at the moment. You can, however, upvote/favorite/bounty Invite low rep users to participate in chat over on MSO if you'd like (proposes allowing higher rep users to invite lower ones into chat). I'd say the best course of action currently is to just hash out as much as you can in the comments, then try to get that information edited into the question. If you reach that point then you can always flag comments for deletion as ""obsolete"", or flag one of the comments with a custom note along the lines of ""every comment after this one is now obsolete etc etc"". That way the comments can get cleaned up and the information will be retained. And, of course, you can encourage the OP to try their hand at answering some questions since you only need 2 answer upvotes to get chat privileges."
