1870,I think its not possible to know from every android device in the world either if they use fastboot or odin or even which sequence of buttons they need to use...i think its just better a generic topic that should point people to xda-developers forum where they can find their right info for their devices plus more generic information about the process 
580,"A few projects in the works that may remediate some of these concerns: Improving the algorithm that controls the official Twitter account so that it brings better content and value to followers. Building relationships with mobile &amp; Android blogs for upcoming collaborations (You will soon see an ad for Android Guys in the sidebar + an upcoming program that will ""port"" over our Android release calendar wiki to Android Guys and other outside sites - Please let me know if you know someone else who wants to host this release calendar). Contests! - This relates to both bullets above. Expect a giveaway in the near future executed through Twitter/Facebook in collaboration with an outside Android and/or mobile site. Any other ideas? Further questions? Also, does anyone have a connection at a major Android manufacturer who can help me get a hold of a Thrill, Bionic, Vigor or Galaxy S II?"
493,"I think a big issue is going to be finding relevant conferences. Google IO sold out in a ridiculously short time, plus I'm pretty sure they don't put out a call for speakers. AnDevCon was OK, but I was pretty disappointed in it as an advanced Android user/developer. Might need to look to some more general conferences such as MADExpo which I saw advertised on MSDN. After a conference is found, finding a speaker shouldn't be a problem: there are plenty of Android fans and developers with plenty to say."
270,"I think we should.  We may not want to expand to Android dev questions and the like, but it would certainly be within the scope of the site to help Android Enthusiasts find resources when they want to get enthusiastic about modding/dev/etc."
762," Matthew Read answered: Android is by-and-large a fantastic site low on the problems faced by many other SE sites.  I don't see any policing aspects to the moderation job here and, regardless, it has to be about serving the community.  If you're not serving the community then you're not doing your job as a mod.  Matthew Read continued: If a community were to be so far gone that you need to really police it, cracking down on questions the community wants and so on, then probably the site isn't viable and I would have expected the team to step in and shut it down before that point.  Al Everett answered: ""Policing"" is looking around for bad actors and problems and doing something about it. ""Serving"" is, to me, is finding what the community needs and working to provide it. I think a moderator needs to do both, but as little as the former as possible to keep things civil.  eldarerathis answered: I'd say it's a bit of a fine line between the two. ""Policing"" to me implies being a bit more active in exercising moderation powers, whereas ""serving"" is a bit more passive, like responding to community flags and such. I would also say, though, that carrying out community consensus without always needing their explicit request (i.e. rules which were decided upon on meta) is serving - not policing. That's where I would generally fall.  Matthew Read clarified: I think I may have interpreted ""policing"" too harshly, based on Al and eldarerathis's answers :P I agree with dealing with problems and not being passive!  Bryan Denny answered: Policing is a bit too strong.  Policing happens when I only want to see things I want to see on the site rather than what the community wants to see. I should be here to facilitate (serve) the community, not my own whims  Flow answered: Serving the community. Policies can change. In fact the should be adjusted from time to time by the community. That assures a healthy climate and progress."
1058,The flag was not declined because the Mod thought that you asked the wrong question. This are two different points. A flag is always a last resort option. The answer is good as it stands and should not be deleted. IMHO there was no reason for you to flag the answer. The fact that the mod expressed concerns about your question has nothing to do with the flag being rejected. About the second point: In principle your question is good as it is. You wanted to know why there are no k9 log in the Android log. But I think that this is not a good question for Q/A sites. I think the better way would be  Android Enthusiasts is no substitution for the infrastructure provided by Android apps. (At least as long as the app provides such infrastructure.)
2232,"I don't know if there is general SE guidance on this, but I would say yes &mdash; clear cut cases seem like a good place for flags.  This site is not at the point where moderators need to heavily triage flags, as yet.  That said, I also go fully through most queues regularly, so a flag is not strictly necessary."
1531,"Usually questions that could fill a whole book as answer are closed as ""too broad"" on all sites within the SX network. I can't comment on why this hasn't happened on the Security SX example question you gave. The have the same policy about ""too broad"" as any other site. But as eldarathis pointed out, the two questions are not on the same level regarding broadness. QA sites like Android Enthusiasts work best if you have a specific problem. And no, wanting to know how Android works is not a specific problem."
2246,"We already have questions about both (and a tag for the latter), so the general answer seems to be ""Yes"".  Agreed with Dan that it depends on the question. I would lean towards saying that anything we allow about Android would be allowed regarding these OSes, but I don't know how far they have strayed from stock Android.  At some point it might not make sense to host questions about them on the same site.  Any restrictions we have about custom ROMs would also apply &mdash; ""don't ask about nightly builds"", etc."
877,"I think they're a direct result of the ""anti-shopping"" policy. We don't want people asking ""what's the best X"". For the most part helping people help themselves is a good thing, and pointing someone to a site that reviews hardware and/or apps gives them such a tool. But I think you're right. All too often it's a situation of ""I do not know how (or I am too lazy) to craft a good web search. Please won't someone do it for me?"" In a lot of cases, we should probably be pointing people to Where can I ask questions that aren&#39;t Android Enthusiast questions? (Assuming we're still keeping that up to date.) I suppose a consideration is ""will this question and its answers be useful to anyone in three months, six months, a year?"" If the answer is ""no"" then it should be closed as too localized. But then each question needs to be evaluated on its own merits. I'm not sure if we can come up with a blanket policy."
