2001,"Here is the breakdown: You had 1+5+2=8 points until an hour ago.      Then you received a downvote on a post of yours which took two points out of the total, ending up at 6 points.  Now, you pretty much had it all figured out, but you're missing the point stated in help center here: (Emphasis mine) This is simply what happened. You received a single downvote (that -1 between the arrows) on your answer which took away  two points from your account and one point from the user who downvoted it."
1210,"When you see a post here on meta titled ""2012 Community Moderator Election Results"" you'll be able to read it and know what the results were. That'll usually happen somewhere between 10 minutes and 24 hours after the election ends.  Of course, someone will probably post the results in chat between 10 and 24 seconds after the election ends. But if that's still not quick enough for you, you can download the OpenSTV software and election data and run it yourself (both will be linked to on the election page immediately after the election ends). How long that takes is up to you. "
896,"Well, you know, there are such things as on-topic questions that no one can answer. Or, more accurately, the person who can answer just hasn't visited the site. A well-written question with the right keywords will certainly draw websearch traffic, so it's only a matter of time until we get an answer (we hope). On the other hand, dozens of ""how do I install OS (x) on device (y)"" won't be helpful. A canonical question to trap them all would be good."
1337,"Looks good, but I miss the info graphic with the 4 circles Wiki, Blog, Digg and ? where Stackexchange is the point in the middle. It always reminded me that I can use Stackexchange sites to document Q&amp;A that may be relevant to other users as well by simply answering my own question in one step."
1674,"I'm partly opposing Dan's answer for the reasons I gave in my comment to it: I doubt there are many ""new users"" doing any research before they post their question. So keeping questions ""as examples how you should not ask"" is a waste, IMHO. I however see a reason to not delete questions which might act as pointers to others. That's best explained using an example:
One of our most frequently asked questions is the ""I forgot my pattern/password and now I'm locked out"" type, which are usually closed as duplicates to Can not unlock my Android device as have no internet connection?. Formerly, that question was phrased ""Can not unlock my tablet..."". When I find such a (new) question and want to VTC it: how to find this ""master question""? Looking for ""Can not unlock my tablet"" makes it hard to find. It however turns out on top of the search when I type in the exact phrasing.
My point? Given a user really does a search before asking, he's unlikely to know the exact phrasing. But with more and more duplicates kept as pointers, chances to have one of them turning up on top of the search results are increasing. Opening that one then leads to the ""final point of interest"". In short words:"
90,You start with 1 reputation point. If you link your user account to an account on another Stack Exchange site you get a free 100 point bonus. Thus 101 reputation without asking any questions or giving any answers. Update: Note that the account you link to has to have a minimum amount of reputation itself (200+) or you don't get the bonus. The thinking is that if you're a good contributor on another site that will likely be true on this one as well.  Linked account didn&#39;t get 100 rep points
1545,"5 points is the number of reputation points you receive when someone votes one of your questions up. It's most likely that someone who had voted up one of your questions in the recent past has been banned or deleted, so their impact on the site has been automatically reversed. See also: “User was removed” means I lose my hard-earned points?"
2345,"Not being a gamer I've never heard about Freedom, so I cannot talk about that. LP on the other hand has some very good and ""ethical"" features, but one can be very much tempted using a few of them in an unethical way (which is why I stopped using it years ago, after having given it a short try). It's sometimes a bit too tempting, so I have no clear ""advice"" here. Nevertheless, a possible approach could be: That's quite ""black and white"", and the hard part is where to draw the line. As phrased in my bullet points, there's a wide ""no man's land"" in between which is likely to lead to debates on ""why is this one closed and the other one not"". So while I'm pretty sure about the ""NO"" part, I don't know if we should vote for the other half."
1996,"[Can] I voluntarily return the whole , half or at least a token sum to the user who offered the bounty[?] As far as I know, you cannot give your reputation directly to someone else. It would game the system if such a provision exists. People, when they feel extremely generous to  a user, tends to serially upvote that user's posts. This is also considered an illegitimate act in the network which shouldn't be considered either. Besides, the act of having that bounty ended up in your account doesn't seem to be a technical loophole but a manual act by OP himself.   Since your answer had three upvotes during the time bounty was active, your answer was already eligible for automatic (half) bounty by Community ♦ user and possibly would've been awarded if OP couldn't have offered it  manually until the grace period ended. What's more? I believe OP did the right thing. Bounties should be awarded to answers which either solved the issue or to those whom the community has upvoted well. It is not mandatory though.  Beska has written here: If the person doesn't want to accept an answer, because their problem isn't yet solved, then award the bounty to the highest rated answer as normal, but don't auto-accept an answer. Then the questioner could hope for more answers, put up more information, perhaps a second higher bounty, etc. There are conflicting answers as well. See them here: Why do I always have to accept an answer at the end of the bounty period?. Now, coming to the point. You can choose to offer a chunk of your reputation points to a user, yet not violating the policies of network, by choosing to offer a bounty to an exemplary answer of that user (a direct transfer) or by offering a bounty on that user's question. The latter wouldn't transfer the points but would help that user greatly. To avoid abuse of system, if you choose the former technique, you would have to wait for 24 hours to award the bounty. OP in this case doesn't seem to have any answer posted on the site, let alone one to be considered exemplary, so you can't go for the former technique. Only option left would be to help him out by using the latter technique.  Alternately would a better solution be for me to delete my answer? As mentioned by Lucky, you shouldn't and need not to delete the post, although I'm not sure whether you can simply delete an answer or would have to vote and wait for it to reviewed, in case it is an upvoted answer.  I believe you shouldn't be having that honesty part troubling you anymore, now that it is clear in my reasoning noted above. I would like you to note that your answer falls in the category of the answers termed as partial answer. Help center states here: (Emphasis mine)  Help us find a solution by researching the problem, then contribute the results of your research and anything additional you’ve tried as a partial answer. That way, even if we can’t figure it out, the next person has more to go on. This is what you simply did, and it's has been considered worthy, hence, you've got 140 points only from a partial answer.  I recommend you put a note in the beginning or the end of the post, stating that ""this is a partial answer"" so that visitors in the future might not get confused as to why your answer (considering that you do not end-up solving the issue) when not solving the issue completely has been upvoted as well as earned the bounty.

2099,"Answers don't determine whether questions are duplicates. If an answer needs updating or another needs to be posted you should do one or all of: However, I'm pretty sure you're not correct about all of those changes since 5.0, since I was able to find and add methods that definitely work on some 5.1 and 6.0 devices.  Try it out. You should also look at my second answer.  This is not supposed to be possible for you to bypass, especially not with a locked bootloader.  That's the entire point of the feature."
