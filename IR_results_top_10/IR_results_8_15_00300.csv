1387,"I say no. ""Unknown sources"" is (should be) about the setting. ""Sideloading"" is (should be) about the act of installing an app outside of the context of the Market/Play Store/etc. They are related, sure, but I don't think they're the same."
62,"I would say [Android-2.2] or [2.2]. I have no idea what most of the code names refer to, and the phones specs I see online only give the version number, not the code name.  I use a phone with android 1.5 - I know it is 1.5, I don't know what variety of food I would refer to it by. And you could tell me in the comments, but I think most new-ish users would have no idea."
155,"Al E.'s great idea just needs a little setting up for those that would miss the reference. Something like: ""Android Questions? These are the Answers you are looking for."" (No comments under 50 rep is a PITA! Sorry for the additional answer)"
475,"Sure. There are plenty of great topics for blog posts that can hopefully go far above and beyond being a mere reference answer for common questions If this gets traction, coordinate with rebecca@stackexchange.com and she can get a provisional blog set up."
311,"I don't think that's necessary. For one thing it's not a change that would be all that universal. What use would, say, English.SE have for QR codes? Besides, the new web market puts QR codes right on the page. It's only a couple of clicks to get the URL for the image and add it to a message. "
1273,"Alternative spellings are good, because they provide different search paths.  Editing a post just to change ""wifi"" to ""Wi-Fi"" would seem to me to be the very definition of a ""too minor"" edit. Like a lot of tech terms, there is no universally accepted spelling. (Not to say that there aren't style guides that try to standardize on one or the other, but we don't adhere to one of those.) Now, if you'd spelled it as ""wife"" (as I've done more than once) then it should definitely be fixed. Otherwise you've got a question better suited for marriage.stackoverflow.com. Similar to how we don't change posts from British spellings, I think for the most part this should just be left alone."
2395,"If you have a better answer, post it. Explain what should and should not be done, and why. Downvote any wrong answers you see. Comment on their flaws when applicable. But don't try to change someone else's answer to say what they did not intend to say. Respect the original author even while disagreeing with them.  Contrary to your claim, there are many dangerously wrong answers on other sites, such as Stack Overflow. Following someone's wrong advice regarding information security can be much worse than destroying a phone. Those answers still exist. When there's is a dangerous misconception around, it's better for it to be voiced and refuted than never be voiced."
2289,"I say, you move beyond the edit and evaluate the worth of the post. If the original post (subjected to translation, when required) holds value to the question (more than just a comment, but may not be a full-fledged answer) and the edit doesn't change the intent of the post, than accept or improve the edit. If the post isn't worth to be an answer at first place or cannot be salvaged or should be a comment, than there is no point in accepting that edit. It would only bring that unworthy post on the front page under Active tab for no good reason. Furthermore, it would award the editor with +2 score. The reputation doesn't matter much here but the encouragement of having such an edit accepted may harm the site in future. Harmful! How come?  Reviewers are supposed to keep a tab on the quality of the posts on the Stack Exchange sites. Whatever they do, it becomes the norm soon.  What to do than, other than to reject the edit? Alright, enough opinion for now.  "
588,"The choices have changed. I suggest that the correct reason is now ""Not Constructive"". As it currently stands, this question is not a good fit for our Q&amp;A format. We expect answers to be supported by facts, references, or specific expertise, but this question will likely solicit debate, arguments, polling, or extended discussion. If you feel that this question can be improved and possibly reopened, see the FAQ for guidance."
822,"I normally save the &lt; kbd > tags for actual hardware buttons (or at least buttons that are normally hardware even if they're sometimes soft) like Power, Menu, Home, Back, etc. For menu options and clicking on items on the screen I'd normally either bold them (or for long options like descriptions on tick boxes ""enclose them in quotes"". So for your example I'd say Settings -> About phone -> Android version Or Settings -> Display -> tick ""Auto-rotate screen"" Or giving a Xoom the ""three-fingered salute"" would be hold down Power + Volume Up at the same time."
