580,"A few projects in the works that may remediate some of these concerns: Improving the algorithm that controls the official Twitter account so that it brings better content and value to followers. Building relationships with mobile &amp; Android blogs for upcoming collaborations (You will soon see an ad for Android Guys in the sidebar + an upcoming program that will ""port"" over our Android release calendar wiki to Android Guys and other outside sites - Please let me know if you know someone else who wants to host this release calendar). Contests! - This relates to both bullets above. Expect a giveaway in the near future executed through Twitter/Facebook in collaboration with an outside Android and/or mobile site. Any other ideas? Further questions? Also, does anyone have a connection at a major Android manufacturer who can help me get a hold of a Thrill, Bionic, Vigor or Galaxy S II?"
77,There are now several people is one lonely guy with 1000+ reputation. (Didn't we get temporary mods?) This is probably no longer necessary.
175,"Yes, excellent idea. It's great way to curb the redundant questions and it's a good sticky post that will likely get some link backs from other sites. Also, I agree, the answers should be updated in the question.  It will get very unwieldy having a separate answer for each phone.  Maybe something like this: Title: 
When will my phone get Android 2.3 (Gingerbread)? Body: 
Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) was released on November 11th, 2010.  This community wiki will list all of the known and rumored dates for devices. If you have an update make sure to follow the format that's been established, and the following guidelines:  If you don't have enough rep to edit the wiki, leave your suggestion in a comment or answer and someone will update the list.  HTC G1 Motorola Droid Motorola Droid X  Enter Tablets Here...  Enter other devices here..."
1556,"Already asked on StackOverflow Meta: EDIT #1: After Flow edited his question, my personal comment earlier is no longer relevant. However, I still agree on the Answer on the SO Meta posts above. Generally, we should edit to make the question clearer. If it's lacking information, we ask for clarifications via comments. We ask them to edit that into their question, or we update it ourselves, based on their comments.  We can either be proactive or guide them to read the guidelines. But I prefer to be more proactive, as if I were gathering requirements from the customer. We ask in a way that we get what we exactly need to make it understandable for us and for everybody. Regarding edits (and based on recent experience), chances are we may not always get it right. It happens. We're either too tired to understand / interpret it correctly (or it's not in our domain of expertise). OR, it could be that the question itself is too confusing to be rephrased. BUT, we can try to make it simpler and easier to read / understand. If our interpretation was wrong, the OP can always comment or improve our attempts to edit. This is peer review in action; we can't always be right. When all else fails - meaning, the question is helpless - the VTC and downvotes come in."
675,"The Android Guys are. The screen shot is obviously from today, as are a good number of the sample questions they suggest. I just wish they'd sorted questions by votes to showcase our ""best of"" stuff."
1314,"Unfortunately, I think there's simply not an ideal solution for situations like this at the moment. You can, however, upvote/favorite/bounty Invite low rep users to participate in chat over on MSO if you'd like (proposes allowing higher rep users to invite lower ones into chat). I'd say the best course of action currently is to just hash out as much as you can in the comments, then try to get that information edited into the question. If you reach that point then you can always flag comments for deletion as ""obsolete"", or flag one of the comments with a custom note along the lines of ""every comment after this one is now obsolete etc etc"". That way the comments can get cleaned up and the information will be retained. And, of course, you can encourage the OP to try their hand at answering some questions since you only need 2 answer upvotes to get chat privileges."
846,"As a new user i know i don't have something to say.
But personally i had never heard of this site before Android Guys wrote an article about your competition, and it was perfect because i had a question which i have looked for in the past month and haven't found any answers too. And suddenly i had a chance to both get a answer on my question and a chance to win a tablet. It was a win win for me, and since i made my user here, i have tried to help a couple of users, and i am pretty sure i will stick here for a good while, because i like the way the site is build and how it is working. So even though i'm a new user, and don't have anything to say, then you should know that the audio competition worked on me :) [off topic]BTW: how do you run this site, there aren't any commercials on the site. Where do you get the money to run the server and buy the prices in the competitions? [/off topic] "
1493,"My suggestion Questions on Android Enthusiasts should be asked from a end-user point
  of view and within the scope defined in the [help]. Not sure if my english is good enough to sound natural. @Native speakers: Feel free to edit and improve. @All: Your comments are welcome :)"
2292,"You can't undo a review approval, but there's something you can do instead. Every post has a revision history, which you can get at by clicking the ""edited time ago"" link below the post. On this page, you can rollback to an older version of the post by clicking the ""rollback"" link on that version. This has the effect of undoing the edit (and any subsequent edits), but the person who suggested the edit still gets the +2 rep. You should explain why in the comment for your edit, because too much rollback-ing automatically raises a flag to alert moderators. As bmdixon points out, just because you approved the edit doesn't mean the mistake is binding. Two reviewers need to approve a suggested edit. If the edit was that bad, presumably nobody else will approve it, so your mistake just means the suggested edit stays in the queue longer before being rejected. Even if somebody else makes the same mistake, the author of the post can now override the review result if they disagree. So it may be that the suggested edit never gets applied in the first place, and there's nothing to correct. Automated review bans aren't a thing on this site. Stack Overflow has them, because there are a lot of users who ""robo review"" - clicking the buttons without thinking - just to get the badges. I'm proud to say we have a much better community here, so there's no need for such a system. Review bans are still possible for us, because the software supports them, but I don't think we've ever used them: there's simply no need. Even if we did use them, one mistaken review that you immediately try to fix wouldn't be a reason to ban you."
351,"Indeed, anyone can propose edits to a question or answer. For those with insufficient privileges to edit outright, these proposed changes go into a queue that is visible to users with 10,000 reputation (or more) and moderators. These users can inspect the change and approve it, reject it, or delete the entire post. If approved, the person suggesting the edits gets 2 reputation points. You can earn up to 1,000 reputation points through suggesting edits; of course once you reach 2,000 points you can edit without prior approval. (Note, of course, that all edits are recorded and can be rolled back if necessary.) When you edit someone else's question or answer, keep these things in mind: However, and more importantly... In other words, your edits should change the readability of the post, not the content. Otherwise, leave a comment."
