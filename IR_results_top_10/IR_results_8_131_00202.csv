1157,"I have nominated myself, so I think I should provide an answer. I believe that a Diamond Moderator should be active, as well as there. They would need to respond quickly to flags - so they can be dealt with. They would also need to have a good rep - so that people can see that they are trustworthy, as well as having been a member for a good while. I believe that a diamond moderator should always shed some light on their decisions - I know this is hardly possible, but I believe that they should comment, and help new members follow the site rules, and stay on topic. I know this has been quick - but this is what I believe."
1206," Liam W answered:  Due to the fact that I haven't been here long, I am going to find this question tricky to answer. I believe that believe that this site is getting more popular, and that the amount of questions is increasing - the same can be said for answers. I am not sure we attract new great users, but we attract new users. I believe that the site is succeeding and improving.  Flow answered:  I think that AN.SX has it's native space in the stackexchange network. The site is very popular according to the traffic stats. And we do have more questions then a year ago. See also my meta post: Statistics about Android Enthusiasts. Not sure if we attract new users, but everyone that struggles with a 1800000 pages thread on XDA is very happy on AN.SX. The site is on a good way, although the diversity of the Android ecosystem makes it hard to answer every question.  Flow continued: We will never be like TEX.SX, although that should be our goal :-D  Suraj Bajaj answered: I think I had mentioned this in my nomination. Here's pasting the same:    My thoughts on Android Enthusiasts:    Being only about a month old member, I have observed a big difference on AE as compared to StackOverflow. A lot of questions go unanswered here and answers come up a bit late. There seems to be a very small number of ""power users,"" and you can see them answer most of the questions. Also the questions and answers on AE are not well written."
1200," Liam W answered:  Flow, without a doubt. He has been here a long time, has been a solid contributor, and has amassed more than 10K rep. He has a large edit count, as well as a decent flag count as well as numerous useful badges.  Flow answered:  To be honest. I think that is Liam. He is highly motivated, native speaker that shows great interest in the site. Although he is relatively new I would give him the chance. But onik and jlehenbauer are just as good. So it's a close call.  Suraj Bajaj answered:  Flow. He has a great contribution. Though I have not been able to follow any of the candidates. This is what I am guessing from the stats."
178,"I have two concerns. One, ""intrusive"" is very subjective. What's intrusive for you may not be a big deal for someone else. Second, and more important, is that I think it's too ambitious and doesn't fit in with this site. The number of tablets is going to grow exponentially and, unless someone is really dedicated, your proposed wiki will never be able to keep up. Once it gets out of date by more than a couple months, it will have lost most of its utility. Plus it has the potential to get really huge. This is the sort of thing that Wikipedia does well. Let them. "
1162,The flavor of Markdown that Stack Exchange uses doesn't support this. I would be against it in any case. Underlines are very commonly understood to indicate links when on web sites. You mess with this very basic and well-understood UI element at your peril. (I can't tell you how many times I've been on some web site and tried to click underlined text and nothing happened.) See also: Why can we format text with bold and italic but not underline? It's been brought up before and unless you can devise a compelling new argument it's not going to be implemented.
1210,"When you see a post here on meta titled ""2012 Community Moderator Election Results"" you'll be able to read it and know what the results were. That'll usually happen somewhere between 10 minutes and 24 hours after the election ends.  Of course, someone will probably post the results in chat between 10 and 24 seconds after the election ends. But if that's still not quick enough for you, you can download the OpenSTV software and election data and run it yourself (both will be linked to on the election page immediately after the election ends). How long that takes is up to you. "
1249,"If it were up to me, I would have a second page displayed when a user clicked to post the question. This page would only be displayed if they are new/have low rep/have a history of off-topic questions. This page would alert them that some questions are off topic, and give them an option to move the question to a better site in the SE network. If they want, they can continue after completing a captcha (or something similar). What do you think?  It could probably be removed after a few weeks of being a member, as long as they have a decent amount of rep, and now closed/deleted questions (or very little)."
737,"It would be more accurate to say ""None that I know of"", because there can perfectly be one, including a private one. Also Stackexchange aims at being a knowledge base, with long term questions and long term valid answers. A ""No"" or ""Not at this time"" is not a long term answer. But actually the question itself is poorly written. It should be ""What application does ..."", having no answer until such an application exists."
2531,"Congrats Andrew, and welcome aboard as our new Moderator. I want to thank Xavier as well for standing up in this election at our hour of need. :) "
1208," Liam W answered:  Hmm. Closing thoughts. I believe I could bring to this site as a moderator - I could improve flag times for when the other mods aren't online, and I could help with the general 'moderating' of the site. I believe I satisfy the pre-requisites of a moderator, and I believe I understand the theory of moderating on  the SE network :)  Flow answered:  I'd like to thank everyone involved in Android Enthusiasts: staff, mods and the active users. Take your time to vote.  Suraj Bajaj answered:  Well, I am really glad I nominated myself. To be honest, I was thinking about my new-ness on the site. But this whole process has helped me understand a lot of things about moderation and the way this site works. It also helped me connect to awesome people like you all. I don't know about results of the election, but this will certainly help me keep my contribution going and may be improving. And sorry for the delay. I had to work real late."
