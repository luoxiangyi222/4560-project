2232,"I don't know if there is general SE guidance on this, but I would say yes &mdash; clear cut cases seem like a good place for flags.  This site is not at the point where moderators need to heavily triage flags, as yet.  That said, I also go fully through most queues regularly, so a flag is not strictly necessary."
1907,"status-completed The icon has been updated. I like the design as well. The ""flair"" icon needs to be updated as it is using the older version: "
917,"The best you can really do currently is to create a new room and then invite the user to that room. You can also leave a link to the room as a comment on their post if you want. The automated chat link will also create a public room, so from that regard it's essentially the same (and you can give it whatever title you want). One downside is that the auto-inserted link will import the comments from the post into the chat room when it's created. Creating your own room beforehand will not do this, but if you are pre-emptively setting up a chat with someone then there is likely not going to be a long comment thread to import anyway, I'd imagine. This has also been discussed on Meta Stack Overflow."
525,"Well, I've installed it on my own site. I've also got the Chrome extension to be able to use it anywhere. I think it could easily go with the Facebook and Twitter links we have already."
1588,"My opinion is that questions which are purely about gameplay (""How do I beat level 5 in Inexplicably Popular Social Game-of-the-Month?"") should go to Arqade. They simply aren't about Android the OS, even if the title is platform exclusive. Configuring hardware or something to work with a game could be OS dependent - something like ""How can I set up a Bluetooth controller for my Android device?"" as an example - and those seem okay, but gameplay questions should be directed to...well, gamers. We may have gamers here, but it's just not our purpose."
1419,"As there (currently) is no way to ""categorize"" related tags, it might also be a good idea to sum them up in the ""most generic"" tag of the group to make them easier to find. For example, the security is such a ""quite generic"" tag. So its tag-wiki could contain a list of related tags such as '2-step-verification', 'malware', 'antivirus', 'lost-phone', and the like. Having such a list in a ""single place"" (i.e. the ""declared master-tag"") makes them easier to manage as well: other places (e.g. other tag-wikis) could simply refer to that place (""for other related tags, also see..."") -- and the ""related-list"" would only need to be maintained once."
243,"Your title is fine. The text of the question gets to the heart of the matter and the specific advice may well apply to other devices. Being too specific would likely keep people from visiting the question. I think you struck a good balance. On the other hand, titles like ""I need help!"" are absolutely horrendous."
155,"Al E.'s great idea just needs a little setting up for those that would miss the reference. Something like: ""Android Questions? These are the Answers you are looking for."" (No comments under 50 rep is a PITA! Sorry for the additional answer)"
1519,"Well, we're all public in some ways. Between all of our linked accounts if someone wants to find a personal email address or web site they're going to find it. This is very poor etiquette by the person who emailed you. They shouldn't have done it. However, there is nothing Stack Exchange can do to prevent it, nor should the person be ""punished"" by Stack Exchange because of something they did off the network. In a way, it's understandable. Very often when you're desperate to find a solution you'll grab at anything that looks like a lifeline. Personally, I suggest to simply ignore them. Perhaps create a filter to automatically delete any messages from them in the future. If you're kind, you might respond with something like I'm sorry, but I can't help you. I am happy to volunteer some of my time helping the people who ask questions on Stack Exchange, but I can't possibly offer personalized help. Good luck to you. If you're feeling snarky, you might further respond with something like However, if you would be willing to pay my hourly rate of $150 per hour, minimum 10 hours, I can probably be convinced to help out. Of course, I would need that money up front and if this can't be done remotely you'll need to pay my airfare as well. I wouldn't recommend that last, though. I'd just simply ignore it and twit 'em."
1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
