311,"I don't think that's necessary. For one thing it's not a change that would be all that universal. What use would, say, English.SE have for QR codes? Besides, the new web market puts QR codes right on the page. It's only a couple of clicks to get the URL for the image and add it to a message. "
313,"I can type into the search box, but I can't seem to get it to submit. When I click the Enter or OK buttons it just seems to change focus to another field. Similarly, I can't figure out how to close the messaging bar at the top of the screen. I can't scroll far enough to the right to close it. Not sure if it matters, but this is with a Motorola Flipside running 2.1."
1011,"Android Stack Exchange gets more than its fair share of ""drive by"" posters. I don't know that that will ever change. As for what to do, I think you've been doing the right thing. But I'll reiterate: Remember: The Questions and their Answers aren't just for the person asking the question, but for future readers as well. A question with good answers is a good thing to have, even if the original asker will never return. On the other hand, questions that no one cares about, not even to answer or vote up, aren't useful to anyone. That's why they're automatically deleted after some time. Six months, if memory serves; four weeks is too short a time."
400,"It is, basically, a measure of how trustworthy your ""flags"" are. That is, what priority posts get when you flag them for moderator attention. The higher the number, the greater weight your flags are given. FAQ: What is 'flag weight'?"
61,"Yes, I find QR links very useful, especially when there are no many barcode scanners around. However, There should be a standard for these ""Here is an App that will help"" posts, just so we aren't A) leaching images, B) not shutting out users who want to see the app without having to go to the market place. Below, I've listed the way I've been linking apps to answers, including how not to leach images (IMPORTANT) because we don't want to get in trouble, now do we? For QR images, I've been using the following method: 1) Find the app on (marketplace e.g. AppBrain) you want to share
 2) Find the QR Code button, and locate the QR code.
 3) Copy the URL of the QR code
 The URL is
 Which is basically  If you use the Image upload tool on the post answer, you can use the image URL to reupload the image to imgur.com
 That way, you get the right QR code, generated from a reliable source, and you don't steal bandwidth. 4) MAKE SURE YOU HREF LINK TO APPBRAIN AT THE SAME TIME
So annoying when you get a QR link, and no web reference to what it is (I'm not sure what other services use, I use AppBrain for a lot of my stuff, but if you know the marketplace URL, just go from step 3 and hardcode the charts.api link yourself) (Freehand circles)"
192,"It's basically asking us to parse the news for the asker. As opposed to any other question that is asking us to parse [google|internet|personal experience] ? But speculative questions have no one right answer until the future is past. In that sense, they may be worse than community wiki."
1166,"If you click the ""help"" link next to a comment box, you'll get a popup with the following information: Comments use mini-Markdown formatting: [link]( _italic_ **bold**&grave;code&grave;. The post author will always be notified of your comment. To also notify a previous commenter, mention their user name: @peter or @PeterSmith will both work. Learn moreâ€¦ If you follow the ""Learn more..."" link you'll get more information about formatting comments than you would think there would be."
527,"Since the more a site or page gets +1 clicks the higher it appears in Google's search results Er.. this isn't true, and if it was there would be, as Robocop once said, ""problems"". These +1s are intimately tied to Social Search, that is, if Google knows who you are and your friend network, those results might be escalated for you only: "
1717,"I think this kind of question is very close to others we've had about enterprise-style deployment of Android devices in businesses and schools. We don't have the right kind of users on the site to give good answers yet, but if we keep getting these questions, the experts will find us soon enough."
2292,"You can't undo a review approval, but there's something you can do instead. Every post has a revision history, which you can get at by clicking the ""edited time ago"" link below the post. On this page, you can rollback to an older version of the post by clicking the ""rollback"" link on that version. This has the effect of undoing the edit (and any subsequent edits), but the person who suggested the edit still gets the +2 rep. You should explain why in the comment for your edit, because too much rollback-ing automatically raises a flag to alert moderators. As bmdixon points out, just because you approved the edit doesn't mean the mistake is binding. Two reviewers need to approve a suggested edit. If the edit was that bad, presumably nobody else will approve it, so your mistake just means the suggested edit stays in the queue longer before being rejected. Even if somebody else makes the same mistake, the author of the post can now override the review result if they disagree. So it may be that the suggested edit never gets applied in the first place, and there's nothing to correct. Automated review bans aren't a thing on this site. Stack Overflow has them, because there are a lot of users who ""robo review"" - clicking the buttons without thinking - just to get the badges. I'm proud to say we have a much better community here, so there's no need for such a system. Review bans are still possible for us, because the software supports them, but I don't think we've ever used them: there's simply no need. Even if we did use them, one mistaken review that you immediately try to fix wouldn't be a reason to ban you."
