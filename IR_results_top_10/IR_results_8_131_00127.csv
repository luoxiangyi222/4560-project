1917,"which newest questions are unanswered  which questions are put on hold  questions with a high bounty  There is simply no way to include every possible search combination as a UI filter, it would be insanely cluttered and completely unusable. If you want to search for a narrower subset of questions instead of a broad category, that's exactly what search is for and what it's good at.  A huge list of filters in the UI is just going to slow you down. You should take a look at  and familiarize yourself with the search operators you find most useful!"
1246,"IMHO there is now way to hold people from posting off-topic/low-quality questions. And this is a OK because if SE would show a big disclaimer before a question could be asked, the usability would suffer. The only way to filter out off-topic questions is afterwards, like the system does now."
1030,I suggest simply making the jailbreak a synonym of rooting. This way users who try to use the tag are automatically pointed to the right term/tag.
2358,"Many common link-shorteners are already blocked by the site because of the problems that they pose. As a general rule, editing the post to replace the shortened links with regular ones is the right way to go, and the same applies with ad-based shorteners. If you feel a specific user is especially overbearing with the links then leaving a comment may not be a bad idea. Flagging one of their posts for the mod team to look at is also a reasonable option, particularly if you find the links to be of questionable usefulness and more for the purpose of driving traffic through the link service."
1992,"While I can follow Firelord's argumentation, it still seems rather a comment than an answer. As a comment, it would be very acceptable: ""It may be … Could you try …"". Then, with the OP having tried and approved, it would be a good answer: solving the issue as proven. Or it would stay a comment when not proven. My approach thus would have been: Flag NAA, leave a comment, convert to comment on the question. BUT: answerer included ""solve the issue as it did for me"", which in fact is kind of prove (empirical) – so it seems to be a valid answer. I agree however it could use a little re-phrasing to make that clear: In my case, this was an issue with Google Now. I was able to solve it this way: Guess you agree: put that way, you wouldn't complain :) EDIT: Sorry for being a bit unclear. I of course didn't mean to say one should always place a comment first :) So in short:"
2157,"You are right in a lot of ways: And so on. However, the site is not ""going down the tubes"" because this is not new.  We have always dealt with high numbers of these questions, and right now our activity levels are pretty consistent with the past. Making rooting questions off-topic is not really an option.  They can be perfectly good questions and answers (example) and are obviously highly relevant to many Android users.  Many of our most active users are also experts on those types of questions &mdash; it is a core part of the site. I also don't think that separating them out into another area/site will help.  One of the biggest issues we have here is people who completely ignore our existing types of off-topic questions, so such separation would (a) be ignored and (b) not reduce the number of low-quality questions in any way. Instead, I think we should focus on how we can improve them.  We've slowly been forming many ""canonical"" questions for common issues; continuing this is important so that we can quickly mark relevant questions as duplicates and reduce the clutter.  There have also been some suggestions that we ask SE to alter the Ask Question interface to have some sort of warning about our scope and the required level of detail which would be helpful if we could convince them to add it."
61,"Yes, I find QR links very useful, especially when there are no many barcode scanners around. However, There should be a standard for these ""Here is an App that will help"" posts, just so we aren't A) leaching images, B) not shutting out users who want to see the app without having to go to the market place. Below, I've listed the way I've been linking apps to answers, including how not to leach images (IMPORTANT) because we don't want to get in trouble, now do we? For QR images, I've been using the following method: 1) Find the app on (marketplace e.g. AppBrain) you want to share
 2) Find the QR Code button, and locate the QR code.
 3) Copy the URL of the QR code
 The URL is
 Which is basically  If you use the Image upload tool on the post answer, you can use the image URL to reupload the image to imgur.com
 That way, you get the right QR code, generated from a reliable source, and you don't steal bandwidth. 4) MAKE SURE YOU HREF LINK TO APPBRAIN AT THE SAME TIME
So annoying when you get a QR link, and no web reference to what it is (I'm not sure what other services use, I use AppBrain for a lot of my stuff, but if you know the marketplace URL, just go from step 3 and hardcode the charts.api link yourself) (Freehand circles)"
1175,Edit: Fixed!  See the new answer on the below Meta post. It's because he has 1 rep temporarily: Bug in &#39;Late Answers&#39; Review Tab I think this is an unintended sideffect?  Or at least a confusing way to have this work.
792,"I am very unlikely to root my device, so I don't really have any skin in this game. That said, I do believe the current canonical question is getting too big and unwieldy. I think ""How do I root device X"" or, even better, ""How do I root Y class of devices"" is a good way to go. I'm concerned, though, about the different ways one can root a device. I would caution against ANY ""how do I root device X with method Y"" questions. I also agree with Flow in that these shouldn't automatically go to Community Wiki. It will take work to put this information together; the people who do should get the reward. We also have a slew of closed questions that can be re-opened and answered. That should make the askers happy. (Although that's not a reason to do this.)"
1317,"You can use some of the advanced search parameters to do this, but I don't think there's a simple link anywhere. The search would be: Which gives you these results. You can expand the ""Advanced Search Tips"" link on the right side of the search page to see other available operators."
