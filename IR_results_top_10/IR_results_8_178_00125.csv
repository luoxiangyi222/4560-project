488,"I really like the design - very clean &amp; elegant. It does occasionally feel a little bit washed out / monochrome however. I'm sure there are specific elements that could be a bit darker or more colourful without changing the overall elegant feel. I think the most constructive thing to do would be to try and identify specific elements like this, as GAThrawn did here. A few more little accents and highlights like this and I'm sure it would all click together beautifully!"
762," Matthew Read answered: Android is by-and-large a fantastic site low on the problems faced by many other SE sites.  I don't see any policing aspects to the moderation job here and, regardless, it has to be about serving the community.  If you're not serving the community then you're not doing your job as a mod.  Matthew Read continued: If a community were to be so far gone that you need to really police it, cracking down on questions the community wants and so on, then probably the site isn't viable and I would have expected the team to step in and shut it down before that point.  Al Everett answered: ""Policing"" is looking around for bad actors and problems and doing something about it. ""Serving"" is, to me, is finding what the community needs and working to provide it. I think a moderator needs to do both, but as little as the former as possible to keep things civil.  eldarerathis answered: I'd say it's a bit of a fine line between the two. ""Policing"" to me implies being a bit more active in exercising moderation powers, whereas ""serving"" is a bit more passive, like responding to community flags and such. I would also say, though, that carrying out community consensus without always needing their explicit request (i.e. rules which were decided upon on meta) is serving - not policing. That's where I would generally fall.  Matthew Read clarified: I think I may have interpreted ""policing"" too harshly, based on Al and eldarerathis's answers :P I agree with dealing with problems and not being passive!  Bryan Denny answered: Policing is a bit too strong.  Policing happens when I only want to see things I want to see on the site rather than what the community wants to see. I should be here to facilitate (serve) the community, not my own whims  Flow answered: Serving the community. Policies can change. In fact the should be adjusted from time to time by the community. That assures a healthy climate and progress."
773,"I was a little disappointed when I opened this and discovered that I will not be receiving free ice cream sandwiches all week, but this idea is neat, too. One suggestion: Could we enforce some kind of minimum question score in order to be eligible for any drawings? Entering everybody would allow people to post really bad questions like ""Why is ICS so AWESOME!"" just to get an entry. I'd be inclined to say that only questions with a score greater than zero should be eligible (so at least someone else thought it was a good question). (I also realize this would be a bit different than the Kindle Fire contest, where it appeared that people with zero score posts were entered into the drawing provided that no other answers on the question were upvoted)"
434,Sometimes a little Google-fu is all you need to solve your problem.
797,"GAThrawn's answer is spot-on, but I'd like to add a little more information."
581,"I guess I fall into the ""middle class"" type of user (at the moment). I like to think I'm being generally helpful and contributing, but there's definitely a large, empty gap in the middle rep ranges which I've wondered about for a while. I'm going to go ahead and throw out a couple of things I've personally observed which have a negative impact on the number of available answerable questions. I don't claim any kind of statistical backing to any of this, mind you: That said, I also think that it's somewhat hard to attract real power users to a Q&amp;A site like this. Now I'm not saying we can't or that we should give up because I really enjoy having Android Enthusiasts around, but the nature of the beast is that much of what happens on e.g. XDA is very discussion based. There's a lot of trial and error, people experimenting with things and almost bricking their phones then collaborating on solutions, and developers putting out bleeding-edge stuff for others to test and give feedback on. We just can't cater to that here, and I think it does affect our userbase to some extent. Is it necessarily a bad thing? No, I don't think so. I'm personally glad to be able to come here when I have a question so that I can ask it without it getting lost in a sea of discussion and just get answers. I do think that it's a little bit of a handicap, though. That turned out to be a bit more lengthy than I intended, but that's my $0.02."
1914,"I reopened the question.  I agree with you that it was just a bit unclear but does seem to be about using an old kernel with a new ROM, which is fully within our purview.  If the user wants to know how to create a custom ROM based on that it would be of-topic, but we give the benefit of the doubt. Do note that closure is intended to be a temporary state before either deletion or editing and reopening (which is why it now says ""on hold"").  Quick closure is generally a good thing since it decreases a post's visibility a bit, so it won't gather downvotes while it's being improved and doesn't gather answers focused on the wrong thing.  It is always fully reversible and editing a closed question always nominates it for re-opening."
603,"Most of the text isn't bold for me? None of the body text in people's questions and answers is (except where sections have been deliberately bolded). Questions titles are, warnings are and some of the stats bits around the edge of the page are, but nothing much else is. What browser are you using and on what operating system? Can you post a screenshot showing which bits are bold that you don't think should/need to be?"
1992,"While I can follow Firelord's argumentation, it still seems rather a comment than an answer. As a comment, it would be very acceptable: ""It may be … Could you try …"". Then, with the OP having tried and approved, it would be a good answer: solving the issue as proven. Or it would stay a comment when not proven. My approach thus would have been: Flag NAA, leave a comment, convert to comment on the question. BUT: answerer included ""solve the issue as it did for me"", which in fact is kind of prove (empirical) – so it seems to be a valid answer. I agree however it could use a little re-phrasing to make that clear: In my case, this was an issue with Google Now. I was able to solve it this way: Guess you agree: put that way, you wouldn't complain :) EDIT: Sorry for being a bit unclear. I of course didn't mean to say one should always place a comment first :) So in short:"
761," eldarerathis answered: I do think moderators have some responsibility to help attract people, and I'd like to try promoting the site a bit more on other sites. We link to XDA a whole lot, but I rarely see links back here from XDA, for example. We fill a nice niche since we're a very focused Q&amp;A site without all the other discussion going on, so I think people from general help forums would find it attractive.  Matthew Read answered: The contests and promotions we've been having are a good start. I don't think moderators are responsible for promotion, but it's certainly an area I want to help with. And true mod responsibilities directly influence how the site is perceived -- it's important to be polite and consistent and all that good stuff to limit how many people are turned off by how SE works. I think our input is also really valuable when it comes to promotion - we know the site better than almost anyone else.  Al Everett answered: I think a moderator should try to bring people in, but also help and encourage others to increase the size and quality of the community. As an Android fan, this isn't the only venue I participate in, and it's not that much effort to point people toward the site, especially when there's an interesting/topical question.  Bryan Denny answered: Anytime I can, I try to mention android.stackexchange to other android users. Here's one particular example:  As a moderator, I don't think it is our job the necessarily be the marketer for the site, but every little bit that we can chip in helps. We should continue with the contests (and adjust some of the rules to help the one-off users like the Kindle contest brought)  Flow answered: No, I don’t feel that this is part of the responsibility as moderator. But I wouldn’t want to become a mod if I wasn’t a big fan of the stackexchange idea, therefore I do promote the sites. :)"
