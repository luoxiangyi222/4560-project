61,"Yes, I find QR links very useful, especially when there are no many barcode scanners around. However, There should be a standard for these ""Here is an App that will help"" posts, just so we aren't A) leaching images, B) not shutting out users who want to see the app without having to go to the market place. Below, I've listed the way I've been linking apps to answers, including how not to leach images (IMPORTANT) because we don't want to get in trouble, now do we? For QR images, I've been using the following method: 1) Find the app on (marketplace e.g. AppBrain) you want to share
 2) Find the QR Code button, and locate the QR code.
 3) Copy the URL of the QR code
 The URL is
 Which is basically  If you use the Image upload tool on the post answer, you can use the image URL to reupload the image to imgur.com
 That way, you get the right QR code, generated from a reliable source, and you don't steal bandwidth. 4) MAKE SURE YOU HREF LINK TO APPBRAIN AT THE SAME TIME
So annoying when you get a QR link, and no web reference to what it is (I'm not sure what other services use, I use AppBrain for a lot of my stuff, but if you know the marketplace URL, just go from step 3 and hardcode the charts.api link yourself) (Freehand circles)"
1870,I think its not possible to know from every android device in the world either if they use fastboot or odin or even which sequence of buttons they need to use...i think its just better a generic topic that should point people to xda-developers forum where they can find their right info for their devices plus more generic information about the process 
399,"My part in that conversation started because travis said that his phone had the same problem as the OP's, so at first I was trying to find a common thread between their two devices. If they were both running ROMs running Sense UI that would suggest that perhaps it wasn't necessarily a hardware-specific issue and those of us trying to help should focus more on their particular firmwares and not just the phones themselves.  When travis said he didn't know I wanted to try to be clear when explaining to him what he needed to know in order to give me a useful answer. I hope that clarifies my seemingly off-topic comments.  :)"
2163,"That particular answer has my vote (and the only vote as of now). The reason I voted (in past I successfully sought moderator attention for deletion of similar posts) is because it doesn't serve what we consider an end-user here by any metric. In any general post, I do not find it objectionable if its author explains how some code is the cause of the problem, but I believe an answer should not limit us to that. The author should strive to find other means to solve the problem instead of asking us to modify the code (because modification of source code is off-topic here so there is no reason we should be suggesting something as an answer which we do not welcome at first place as a question). If the author fails to find other means or comes to a conclusion that only the modification of source code would solve the problem then they should bother to stress that in their answer. I do not see any need to treat that post as an exception. If the author believes that their time and efforts have not been compensated with review from competent peers and their upvotes then I recommend they frame up an appropriate question on SO or on a forum of programming questions and then post their answer. That would be best for everyone with no harm done to anyone.  I'm sure that those adventurous users in our community must be active on SO or in other programming questions forum given the nature of their interest so their interests won't be hurt either if my recommendation is followed. "
62,"I would say [Android-2.2] or [2.2]. I have no idea what most of the code names refer to, and the phones specs I see online only give the version number, not the code name.  I use a phone with android 1.5 - I know it is 1.5, I don't know what variety of food I would refer to it by. And you could tell me in the comments, but I think most new-ish users would have no idea."
116,positroni.cc  (double-c because there is no .ic TLD that I can find to register with) You know. From Asimov. nevermind.
1453,"Admins and 10K+ users can see deleted questions/answers, and I think you can see your own ones too if you know the URL for them. What was the question about and do you know which day you deleted it? We can have a look through the mod tools and see if we can find it."
2363,"This site isn't a forum. There aren't ""follow-ups"" here: there are questions and answers. If you want to ask a question, use the Ask question button. If you know the answer to a question, write it in Your answer under that question. It doesn't matter how relevant it is: if it's not an answer to the question, it doesn't belong there. People who know the answer to your question won't see it if it's not posted as a question, and they can't help you, because you can't answer an answer. Running the site in this format is what makes it a repository of information that's easy to find and navigate, without the problems of thread hijacking and ""me too"" posts that you get on a forum. It means that people who know about the thing you're asking about will see your question on the front page of the site: you're not relying on them looking on the n-th page of a thread about a related question that they're not going to look at because they already know the answer. The tour is a really brief introduction to all of this. You get a badge for reading it, but more importantly, you also learn how to get your questions answered by experts."
1000,"Answer it, it is almost certain that you're not the only person experiencing the issue, and other people might have the same problem that will be helped by knowing that the issue is fixed in the newer version, that will convince them to update or at least they may be able to find a workaround after knowing the nature of the problem. Make sure to include the version info of the buggy software and the version that fixed the problem."
2144,"I agree that power is a bit uninformative. I'm not yet convinced that making it a synonym for power-on is the right thing in the long term. While a lot of existing uses of power are about startup, there are a lot more about the power button. If those questions start being tagged with power-on, then that tag will become as useless as power is now. Maybe we need a new power-button tag."
