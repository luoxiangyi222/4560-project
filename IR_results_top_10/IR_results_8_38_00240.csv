1566,"Maybe de-synonym remote-desktop for Android-controlling-non-Android and use remote-access for controlling-Android-from-anything. Also, perhaps remote-control could be repurposed for questions regarding the IR emitters some devices (Samsung GS4 and Galaxy Mega, HTC One, LG Optimus G Pro, etc.) are starting to include."
1563,"I would agree to merging them. remote-control is described as as: Remotely control your Android device from any other device/computer,
  or vice versa. remote-access is described as: Methods to remotely access a device from another device, where at
  least one of the two should be running Android. Interestingly, remote-desktop is a synonym of remote-access, which makes it even more confusing if Al Everett describes remote-control as seeing the ""desktop"". UPDATE #1: However, we could probably make a distinction between: However, the second point may be useless, given that it may be via Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc"
1365,"Done.  I'm going to double check right now for any ""remote access"" questions that might need to be retagged. Edit: remote-control and remote-access are still a bit messy.  I'm not sure if we should merge them or what.  I don't think there are many questions about using devices as TV remotes so fortunately that isn't complicating things :)"
1588,"My opinion is that questions which are purely about gameplay (""How do I beat level 5 in Inexplicably Popular Social Game-of-the-Month?"") should go to Arqade. They simply aren't about Android the OS, even if the title is platform exclusive. Configuring hardware or something to work with a game could be OS dependent - something like ""How can I set up a Bluetooth controller for my Android device?"" as an example - and those seem okay, but gameplay questions should be directed to...well, gamers. We may have gamers here, but it's just not our purpose."
1597,"Scripts can have accounts too. It would be easy for a spammer or other malicious user to sign in and then give control to his script. Having the possibility of a CAPTCHA for signed-in users prevents this attack. The system has a few ways to guess whether particular activity is from a genuine user. Full details aren't available to us end-users, because that would make the system too easy for attackers to defeat. One common way to make the check go wrong is to leave a page open for a long time before submitting the form; for example, you start to answer a question, then get interrupted, go to lunch, come back an hour later, finish answering the question, and then get the CAPTCHA when you try to post your answer. This is because of a token in the page that expires after some time."
580,"A few projects in the works that may remediate some of these concerns: Improving the algorithm that controls the official Twitter account so that it brings better content and value to followers. Building relationships with mobile &amp; Android blogs for upcoming collaborations (You will soon see an ad for Android Guys in the sidebar + an upcoming program that will ""port"" over our Android release calendar wiki to Android Guys and other outside sites - Please let me know if you know someone else who wants to host this release calendar). Contests! - This relates to both bullets above. Expect a giveaway in the near future executed through Twitter/Facebook in collaboration with an outside Android and/or mobile site. Any other ideas? Further questions? Also, does anyone have a connection at a major Android manufacturer who can help me get a hold of a Thrill, Bionic, Vigor or Galaxy S II?"
1663,"It's nothing to do with the number of URLs... It's how they're formatted:  Since there are no spaces, the URL parser thinks the entire string  is a URL - and of course, this is not a valid URL! There are a few possible work-arounds here: Leave off the  This is the easiest, since the URL parser will just ignore it - but it also changes the actual error message, so this is somewhat undesirable. That said, in this specific case you shouldn't actually be passing ""http"" to telnet anyway.  Use code formatting for the URL. Surround the URL in backtics, and the URL parser will ignore it. Example: Connecting To  not open connection to the host, on port 23: Connect failed Put the entire error in a code block. By indenting four spaces instead of using the > prefix, the error message will be rendered as code and ignored by the URL parser. The downside of this is that it will all appear on a single line: Use HTML blockquote syntax. By eschewing Markdown entirely, you can obtain much greater control over what is rendered. So writing this: ...produces this: Note that you'll have to escape any invalid HTML in the quote in order for this to work. "
764," eldarerathis answered: If I'm being truly honest, I have no idea :) I think I enjoy seeing things run smoothly and look nice. Plus, poor quality posts reflect poorly on the community, whether consciously and subconsciously. I'm a member of that community, so I want to make sure that I (and everyone else who's put so much hard work into this site) am well represented. We're contributing to the knowledge base of the Internet. No reason to do it halfway.  Al Everett answered: Too many out-of-control forums? I have seen ""broken windows"" bring down other sites in the past. I like this site too much to stand idly by and fall into chaos, especially when I can help keep that from happening.  Matthew Read answered: I'm an engineer and a little pedantic :P I like things to work smoothly and be in order and correct.  I like to act and not just converse.  I like helping the site and community in multiple areas.  Bryan Denny answered: Reputation is nice, but at the end of the day it is number. As a moderator you actually get to keep things in order. I enjoy it because I want to see this style of community thrive over hard to read forums  Flow answered: I enjoy both, but moderation and janitorial tasks satisfy my pursuit for structure and organization. Although my desk sometimes speaks a different language. ;-)"
546,"Yeah, that's vague and a meta-tag. I'll see if I can clean up some of those. Update: Okay, I've cleaned the 5 that just had ""information"". Most of them were changed to system-info so that's probably a good synonym."
1991,"It just came to my mind, what would be our reaction if it is written as:  ""Go to Google app which use your location to personalize it. Go to app and disable it. Hope it helps.""  It is still a hypothesis because it isn't proved how Google app is related to the question, but since in my made up answer the user wrote with confidence, we wouldn't be having  much reason to flag it as VLQ, other than content based issue. Now, for the real point. In its current condition, it's not a very low quality answer for two parameters but one, which I explained below.  Reasoning for VLQ isn't very clear but the flag excerpt says: This question has severe formatting or content problems. This question is unlikely to be salvageable through editing, and might need to be removed.  The reason I didn't mark it as a VLQ answer is because we have multitude of such answers on the main site, and while they don't reason well, they many times help the visitors to get rid of the issue, which the latter is most interested in. The suggestion I would like to give is to use a downvote (if only you're convinced that the answer is wrong or not useful), or leave a comment explaining the issue and providing suggestion.  I see that you upvoted my comment, so you indirectly already did your part of commenting on the answer. Note that to flag or not to flag as VLQ  also creates a dilemma of whether to allow such answers on this site or be moderate/strict in controlling them. If you're a moderate/strict in approach then don't think your action as unreasonable even if your flag ends up as Declined. As for me, I use all the approaches all the time! "
