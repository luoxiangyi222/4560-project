2087,"Be specific If you ask a vague question, youâ€™ll get a vague answer. But if you give us details and context, we can provide a useful answer. I find this not precise. What details are we expecting from them? At least we should give them a hint as an example, either on same page or with links pointing to high quality questions or templates demonstrating what kind of minimum or recommended amount of information a question should have. There are users (like me) who doesn't pick up easily or do not understand what to pick up if you don't give them examples or even hints. That guideline lacks that crucial info. Following are the solutions scattered across this site or on other sites that I picked up: Unlike other sites, for first time users, this is what Stack Overflow shows to them (a mandatory read):  I don't think it would help us at all, given that Stack Overflow itself is far from solving the problem of unclear and low-quality question even after having this solution for years. Supplementary readings: Forget about readings, we have this approach discussed here: When asking a question, enforce user to read the FAQ first, and the most upvoted answer (from a moderator) notes: It won't work. Like we all do with EULAs, they'll tick the box without reading and keep going. If there's any fanciness like a timer or making sure they scroll the page, they'll just cheat it and still not read it. (Emphasis mine) It is interesting to note that the author of that answer was in favor of that solution when it was implemented long time ago on Stack Overflow. :D I personally too do not find this approach much useful for the same reason. The recently asked question Adding a template question to the Ask Question box seeks input on that regard. It has not received any counter argument as an answer, but neither a helpful answer that sketches out what needs to be there in a template. I find this approaching appealing simply because I couldn't find a way to confirm that it has no merit or less merit relative to other approaches. At first read, it appears to be useful since it can at least acknowledge  the poster the need to mention Android version, Device name, rooting status, among other things we need to sketch out. Note that it is not fine for us to seek such crucial details since posting a comment for such clarification is quite a waste of our time. Don't you agree? But since the given circumstances doesn't give any excuse to us, we're left with one option: to invest/waste our time on something which should've been there at first place. Like every other approach, there is no guarantee that it would work or significantly bring down the amount of time we end up wasting on such questions, but our aim should always be to do the best we can to solve the problem. We may not be able to eliminate it but we shouldn't just live with it either, unless all feasible solutions are considered. Forget it please! It has not stopped the wrath of NAA we receive, so better not be considered for implementation IMO. Note: You need to do some work now!"
279,"Well, the link is using rel=""nofollow"", so the site's not getting any googlejuice. Just because there's a link to a site does not mean that Stack Exchange or the members of the Android Enthusiasts site endorse it, and I don't think anyone would think that. Also, anyone who doesn't follow safe browsing is not going to be protected by us. Without a link it would be academic to find the site via other means. If the link went somewhere other than what it purported to (goatse anyone?) then it might be a problem. As is I don't think it is a problem. I'm interested in other opinions, however."
699,"In going back through the unanswered questions, the following twelve seemed to be more likely to garner a response or interest from average user types.  "
192,"It's basically asking us to parse the news for the asker. As opposed to any other question that is asking us to parse [google|internet|personal experience] ? But speculative questions have no one right answer until the future is past. In that sense, they may be worse than community wiki."
1773,"Custom flags (those raised using the ""other"" reason) are intended for things that cannot ordinarily be handled by the community. These flags go directly to the moderators, whereas other flags will go into various review queues that can be acted upon by other users of the site. Someone saying ""thanks"" is simply not something that is generally going to require direct moderator intervention. It is not actively harmful to the site, and there are tools already available to you that are appropriate for the situation: Secondly, as Dan alludes to in his answer, if you do use the ""other"" flag reason, you need to be really, excruciatingly specific in your message. Your flag is basically telling us ""Hey, something is wrong, and I, as a regular user, am unable to handle it with the current tools. I need a moderator!"" Entering your flag description as ""saying thanks"" doesn't provide us with enough information to act on. In the context of this flag, you actually raised two separate flags on the same post, one minute apart from each other. The first is the flag you noted above. The second was a flag on one of the comments on the post. Moderators cannot respond to comment flags, so we had to respond to the post flag instead, which appeared to be connected in purpose to your comment flag based on the timestamp and the content of each flag."
1303,"It won't work. Like we all do with EULAs, they'll tick the box without reading and keep going.  If there's any fanciness like a timer or making sure they scroll the page, they'll just cheat it and still not read it. There are already lots of pointers to the FAQ and asking guidelines when you post here for the first time.  (Log out and take a look!)  We can do our best to make sure that content is available and helpful, but we can't do anything about the users who refuse to make use of it. See also: Add &quot;I have read the FAQ&quot; check box to the Ask Question page among many others."
1831,"I just saw a question a few minutes ago that was asking about if there was anything he could do to temporarily be unblocked by a person on WhatsApp, but it was closed by an admin because it was too subjective.. I think that if someone was looking for an app reveiw,, he should read the app description first, then the reviews instead of bothering us with their laziness."
1320,"Sorry for the late answer. There should be a notification when the question is closed (at the same time that the submit button is disabled). I assume the following is what happened: Roughly around the time you posted this, we revamped our notification system, and during this time, there was a bug which caused the notifications (like the ""the question has been closed"" one) not to be displayed. This bug was already fixed when you posted this bug report, but given the time frame, I assume your browser cache still had the JavaScript file with the bug in it at that point. Sorry about that."
718,"It might be valuable to expand our current question to include version numbers.  The ""gingerbreak"" exploit has been fixed in newer versions of 2.3, for example. I think having a separate question for each device would get out of hand, however.  That list has 50ish devices, which would basically mean 50 times the upkeep if they were split up.  I do understand your point about voting, but I think the community can be trusted to remove terrible instructions, add disclaimers, and add newer/better instructions. If there are unique circumstances, e.g., something that should work for your device and version does not or softbricks your device or something, you can absolutely ask a separate question about that.  So far the wiki has been pretty useful in keeping all of the basic questions from cluttering the site and being harder to find, though -- there are 69 dupes. Several of us who are familiar with XDA and other sites frequent the chat room.  I and I'm sure others would gladly try to help you find the info you're looking for if you give us the details.  The other method to try to solicit this information is through a bounty on the wiki question stating what you need. As for the problem at hand: Have you tried following the guides listed at the top of this XDA thread?  In particular, some variant of Koush's (flashing recovery and then a rooting package or a rooted ROM) should work regardless of your software version, since the Nexus S has an unlockable bootloader."
75,"I'm the administrator of Force Close. Robert did offer for us to join the StackExchange 2.0 network, but I declined because I want to keep ownership of the site. I plan to move to OSQA or some other clone when our subscription expires, and I am going to continue promoting the site. Summary: Q&amp;A showdown at high noon."
