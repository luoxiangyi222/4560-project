1792,"As for the extra 1 you haven't accounted for: every user starts with one reputation point, not zero."
77,There are now several people is one lonely guy with 1000+ reputation. (Didn't we get temporary mods?) This is probably no longer necessary.
2001,"Here is the breakdown: You had 1+5+2=8 points until an hour ago.      Then you received a downvote on a post of yours which took two points out of the total, ending up at 6 points.  Now, you pretty much had it all figured out, but you're missing the point stated in help center here: (Emphasis mine) This is simply what happened. You received a single downvote (that -1 between the arrows) on your answer which took away  two points from your account and one point from the user who downvoted it."
2176,"I agree. As the 1+1 uses oneplus-one, I'd say oneplus-two should be the one to stay. There's no oneplus-1 synonym, so I guess we don't want oneplus-2 stay as such?"
1545,"5 points is the number of reputation points you receive when someone votes one of your questions up. It's most likely that someone who had voted up one of your questions in the recent past has been banned or deleted, so their impact on the site has been automatically reversed. See also: “User was removed” means I lose my hard-earned points?"
2089,"I too think it is pretty much off-topic. Example 1: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one should I buy? We simply can't know the expectations and parameters of choice of any person. Example 2: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one is
better? Since utility of a good is not quantifiable, the answers are going to be pretty much subjective and opinion-based. Example 3: I want a phone with following specs: blablabla Can you guys suggest any? There are websites that find phones with the desired specs already."
90,You start with 1 reputation point. If you link your user account to an account on another Stack Exchange site you get a free 100 point bonus. Thus 101 reputation without asking any questions or giving any answers. Update: Note that the account you link to has to have a minimum amount of reputation itself (200+) or you don't get the bonus. The thinking is that if you're a good contributor on another site that will likely be true on this one as well.  Linked account didn&#39;t get 100 rep points
1179,"You can vote for this one person as your first choice, and it will be counted towards it. Your other two votes will be wasted however."
1649,"If there is no particluar reason for a subversion tag, which seems to be the case, then we don't need one and the two tags should get merged."
1790,"The difference in rep-points is 15, which suggests someone might have accepted one of your answers before you checked first time (46), and decided otherwise during the same day (46-15=31). As that makes 15-15 on the same day, it's not shown as one action canceled out the other ""immediately""."
