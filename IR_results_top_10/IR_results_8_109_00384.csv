2378,"Oh my, I just found the solution:  So the solution is indenting the target text by eight spaces It seems my issue was that I was trying to create preformatted block within a list. For related markdown this article also helps, Markdown help. They also state another way of doing this;
Highlighting target text and pressing ctrl+K"
917,"The best you can really do currently is to create a new room and then invite the user to that room. You can also leave a link to the room as a comment on their post if you want. The automated chat link will also create a public room, so from that regard it's essentially the same (and you can give it whatever title you want). One downside is that the auto-inserted link will import the comments from the post into the chat room when it's created. Creating your own room beforehand will not do this, but if you are pre-emptively setting up a chat with someone then there is likely not going to be a long comment thread to import anyway, I'd imagine. This has also been discussed on Meta Stack Overflow."
848,"There is so much text here, so I will keep it short: I had the same thought. Tag based promotion just doesn't work well on AN.SX. IMHO the best promotion is purely reputation based, with a slight addition. Something like: or just Where winners will be randomly chosen between the eligible users. Maybe this will also attract more users to edit the tag wiki to earn the rep."
60,"QR codes are great.  Just make sure to also make the images a link to what the QR code is pointing to (for people who are browsing this site on their phones). There is also an ASCII QR code generator, but not sure how well they'd work here."
63,"As soon as you link to warez/cracks of commercial apps you make it likely that this board becomes NSFW to filters. That means close that question/comment immediately. This is a q/a about android, true; but it also needs to be on par with Stack Exchange as a standard."
1947,"That one seems a bit borderline to me. The reason used, ""Questions which are Android-independent...are off-topic..."" is technically correct. I'd expect that Instagram in iOS would act the same way.  But it's also not like you can go to the website and create an account; you can only create an account by installing the app. So I think the question is fine here, even if the answer is probably ""you can't""."
1419,"As there (currently) is no way to ""categorize"" related tags, it might also be a good idea to sum them up in the ""most generic"" tag of the group to make them easier to find. For example, the security is such a ""quite generic"" tag. So its tag-wiki could contain a list of related tags such as '2-step-verification', 'malware', 'antivirus', 'lost-phone', and the like. Having such a list in a ""single place"" (i.e. the ""declared master-tag"") makes them easier to manage as well: other places (e.g. other tag-wikis) could simply refer to that place (""for other related tags, also see..."") -- and the ""related-list"" would only need to be maintained once."
1309,"I created android-emulator to house all of the questions related to the Android emulator  specifically, then retagged the questions that were about other kinds of emulation. I also re-worked the emulator wiki/excerpt to make it clear that it's for non-Android emulators. If I missed any questions in the retagging, feel free to fix them up."
1303,"It won't work. Like we all do with EULAs, they'll tick the box without reading and keep going.  If there's any fanciness like a timer or making sure they scroll the page, they'll just cheat it and still not read it. There are already lots of pointers to the FAQ and asking guidelines when you post here for the first time.  (Log out and take a look!)  We can do our best to make sure that content is available and helpful, but we can't do anything about the users who refuse to make use of it. See also: Add &quot;I have read the FAQ&quot; check box to the Ask Question page among many others."
1403,"Keep the wiki excerpt short and focused on what the tag means on this site. For instance, email doesn't need to describe what electronic mail is, but rather it should explain that it is for question about email on Android devices in general and the built-in default email app in particular. Also, don't include an instruction to ""see the info link below"" to direct the reader to the full tag wiki. While that works on the tag info page, the wiki excerpt is displayed in multiple other places (like the mouseover window) where there is no ""info"" link for the reader to click."
