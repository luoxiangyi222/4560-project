347,"It's generally sufficient to link to the other question and explain why it doesn't meet your needs. All we're looking for is some kind of evidence that the question asker put some effort into it, and this clearly meets that bar."
1333,"Minor edits should come with added value, like rephrasing the sentences or titles so that they are clearer or easier to understand, adding formatting, or editing the tags where applicable. Minor wrong spellings are where we need to think twice on editing. Sometimes, they are  forgivable, sometimes not. But removing ""thanks"" and ""regards"" alone is TOO minor. As for gaming the system, I agree with the others. These points are too small to be an issue. If this was the motivation alone, then it's not worth the effort. Better things can be done with people's time. So, we should appreciate these types of users who are active in keeping the community clean. [You would want this kind off community in Foursquare] Although we have enough moderators and high-rep members who can do these tasks better, these types of users are better off working on more important moderating tasks. At the end, though, we should strive to make things easier to read / understand."
2187,"A duplicate answer is an answer that does not add any information not alerady in an older answer. Note that the above text is only an example, but you need to provide the link to the original answer, if you want quicker mod action and/or don't want mods to search for a possibly long time to find the original answer because they have to do other things too and you are uselessly delaying them with that. At the bottom of every answer, just above the comment section, there are at least these 3 buttons: ""share"", ""edit"" and ""flag"" (if this isn't there you couldn't flag in the first place.) Then, go to the duplicate answer and do step 5 (or 5.2, if you managed to keep the flag window open all that time). A duplicate answer is a duplicate, no matter when it is posted. It just needs to be posted at least 1 second later than the original one in order to be recognizable as a duplicate."
817,"How many questions of this type are we talking about? How many questions are migrated from here to SO on a daily basis? This would be a fair amount of work, and I'd need to know that it's because there are 10+ questions of this type. Often for low volume stuff, handling it manually is the best option until the volume increases. It's also a little tricky since the intrinsic tag on this site has to exist on the target site, etc. Looking here:  I see 10 questions going to SO for the month of November."
440,"I tend to agree. I haven't looked, but I'll wager that a good portion of those questions don't need the tag for the desktop OS anyway."
903,"I've gone through old posts and closed/deleted them before, but I think you have to be careful with ones you think are Too Localized.  An old unanswered question featuring something you've never heard of will definitely seem localized, but that's actually different from the close reason.  We close things that are Too Localized by nature, rather than by content. For example, a shopping question will always become out of date and will rarely be relevant to others; a perfect candidate for Too Localized.  On the other hand, someone's strange connection issues on a non-name tablet only seem localized until other people show up with the same issue.  Hopefully we can see the difference. I haven't looked at any of your flags yet so I don't know what you've considered Too Localized, but I think this is something we should keep in mind regardless.  Edit: I see a number of them were owned by dead accounts and didn't have enough information to be answerable.  With no one around to provide that information, flagging these is definitely the right thing to do. I do agree with Al's general sentiment that if it doesn't need to be dealt with by a mod, then we can let the voting and so on filter it out.  If you're flagging things that need it, though, by all means do so.  I'd prefer a clogged flag queue over an empty one because at least we have a list of the things that need attention instead of being clueless :)"
30,"My opinion: If the question specifies how an app would be ""like"" X, as in providing a list of required features/constraints, then that's OK. But in that case, you don't really need the ""App X"" in there.  I suppose it doesn't hurt, but you could just say ""I'm looking for an app with these 10 features."" Unless these questions are significantly constrained, there's no appreciable difference between them and What X app should I get? questions.  I'd at least be suspicious of any and all questions taking this format, as they are likely to be treated as polls."
1847,"If you want to manually award a bounty, you need to click the bounty icon next to the answer you've chosen. It looks a faded version of the icon that appears after a bounty is won by an answer:  Accepting an answer does not explicitly award a bounty. You could, for example, bounty a different answer if you chose. However, since you accepted an answer and did not explicitly award the bounty to anyone, the full bounty was automatically awarded to the answer you accepted once the grace period expired. Had you not accepted an answer, then half the bounty would have been awarded to the highest scoring answer (with a score of at least 2) posted after your bounty began. Additional information can be found in the Help Center article: What is a bounty?."
2385,"Good find. Merge completed. I don't think this needs a synonym (neither the old on7 nor another galaxy-on7: if you type ""galaxy-on7"" in the tag box, samsung-galaxy-on7 pops up automatically, same if you only type ""on7""."
2405,"I think it's important to look past the words the questioner happened to use, to see what the intent of the questioner is, and I wish close-voters would put a little more thought into that. This isn't 3-2-1, and you shouldn't lose everything just because you happened to use the magic word ""app"" in your question. Recommendation questions are opinion-based. They ask for lists of answers, and they tend to get spam answers as a result. The answers are less useful than Google Play search results, because they go out of date quickly. This is why we don't like them on the site. Which is the best music player? or Is there a good third-party SMS app? These are simplified examples of bad questions. What kind of answer will they get? A million answers saying ""I like such-and-such app, it's the best"" with no justification. An answer with a one-off copy-paste of Izzy's app lists, which will slowly go out of date or need editors to keep updating it over time. I have a bunch of CSV files in Google Drive and I need to download them when they change and add the results up. Is there an app for that? or I play games on my tablet with my kid ""helping"" sitting on my knee. He often grabs the rim of the tablet and pokes the volume button and makes it really loud. I need the volume buttons turned off when I'm playing a game. Is there an app for that? This doesn't seem like a ""recommendation"" question to me. What kind of answer will it get? There still might be more than one. It might say, ""Use such-and-such app, it can do this out of the box,"" but more likely, it'll say ""You have to install Pushbullet or IFTTT to find out when the file changes, then use Tasker to schedule downloading them and open Excel for Android to load the CSV files,"" or ""You need a custom ROM for this. Lineage can do it."" The difference is, you can replace ""Is there an app?"" with ""How do I solve my problem?"" without really changing the meaning of the question. In the recommendation questions, you can't do that. I think that's the crucial difference. If I find a question like this second pair of examples in the close vote queue, I'll typically make that edit so that people don't close the question, but I don't think the edit should be needed. Just because someone thought an app is the most likely solution to their problem, that doesn't turn a good problem-solving question into a recommendation question. I think we should all apply that test in our head: can I replace ""is there an app?"" with ""is there a solution?"" without changing the meaning of the question."
