841,"I think you're seeing one of two behaviours that changed recently with @replies. Essentially the @reply isn't auto-completed (and is often removed when you post) if there is only one possible, unmistakable person who's the target of your post and so your @name bit would be redundant. So if you're making a comment on a question that has no answers, and it's the very first comment, then you are obviously making a comment to the questioner, so adding @name is redundant. The other thing that's changed is that when SE thinks that two people are having a conversation (when there's only two of you commenting and you're going back and forth between you) then the @name is removed too, as it's obvious who you're talking to. In these cases even though there's no @name in your comment, because it's obvious who you're talking to the person that you're talking to will still get notified that you're talking to them (for instance question askers are always notified when someone comments on their question with @naming anyone else)."
896,"Well, you know, there are such things as on-topic questions that no one can answer. Or, more accurately, the person who can answer just hasn't visited the site. A well-written question with the right keywords will certainly draw websearch traffic, so it's only a matter of time until we get an answer (we hope). On the other hand, dozens of ""how do I install OS (x) on device (y)"" won't be helpful. A canonical question to trap them all would be good."
1011,"Android Stack Exchange gets more than its fair share of ""drive by"" posters. I don't know that that will ever change. As for what to do, I think you've been doing the right thing. But I'll reiterate: Remember: The Questions and their Answers aren't just for the person asking the question, but for future readers as well. A question with good answers is a good thing to have, even if the original asker will never return. On the other hand, questions that no one cares about, not even to answer or vote up, aren't useful to anyone. That's why they're automatically deleted after some time. Six months, if memory serves; four weeks is too short a time."
1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
872,"Unfortunately, the name ""Android Enthusiasts"" is so close to generic that it's very unlikely we'd be able to stop them from using it. However, our wonderful core developers have told me it's pretty easy to make that hyperlink in the Google results say ""Android Enthusiasts - Stack Exchange"" rather than ""Android - Stack Exchange,"" so that change will be implemented soon. If you're looking to become their friends, maybe a representative from this site could join one of their future hangouts as a special guest? Just a suggestion; interact or don't interact with them as you wish. :) As Matthew Read pointed out, this site is the top Google hit when searching ""Android Enthusiasts"" so there's nothing to worry about right now. They probably just didn't know this site exists and already uses the name they decided to adopt a week ago."
992,"I was the person who rejected those, though from memory you had a queue of about 20 suggested edits on that morning and I'm pretty sure I approved at least half of them. It stuck in my mind because that was an awful lot of edit suggestions from one person, and some of them were very long. I'm sorry if I caused any offence by this, one reason I didn't pick any of the default rejection reasons but instead wrote out a custom one explaining why I'd rejected them was so that you could see why I'd done it. There's no questions tagged with this, it has no reason to exist That was my comment as I rejected those edits. From memory all of your edits were creating new Tag Wiki's and Tag Wiki Excerpts. The very first thing I do when I see a tag wiki edit of any kind in the queue is click the tag, read through the questions currently tagged with that tag, and then come back and see if the wiki edit suggestion seems to match the intent of the questions. When I clicked through the tags you've highlighted above I honestly couldn't see any questions tagged with them. In a couple of cases, because it did look odd to be submitting so many tag wiki's for non-existent tags, as well as clicking through to the tag and going through the tabs (newest, faq, votes, active, unanswered) I also ran searches for the [tag name] on the site, and still couldn't see any questions tagged with those tags. Looking now, there definitely are questions tagged with the tags you point out, and if you re-submitted your edits, I wouldn't reject them again. As to what happened on the day, I genuinely couldn't find any questions using those tags, which means that anything in them will be automatically deleted by the StackExchange engine. However when I look at the edit dates on those questions, a lot of them had the tag in question added before I serached for it, which is odd, and I can't explain what's happened there. I don't know what happened there, and I'm sorry if I caused you any offence, but as far as I could see at the time what I said was true when I looked, and I can't explain why what I was seeing was different from what you saw."
2323,"What's the intent of OP? ...Changing the date and time in the phone can ""evade"" the version and trial and continue to use it Further, they want to know .... if it was possible to change the date of a single app even by changing the source code of 'App To my mind, there is no ambiguity around that Is it legal ? - we are not equipped to discuss Is it ethical ? To me clearly, NO Could OP have other valid reasons for asking , which might have triggered this question ? - possible,  but if not stated, let's not assume either ways but go by what's presented ( also note that there was no response to my first comment, stating that it is unethical ) Should we permit such questions (not withstanding the fact that a diligent search on Internet would reveal ways and means ) ?? Emphatic NO"
2434,"I think you're right that there could be a canonical ""how do I identify which app sent a notification?"" question, and I'd encourage you to write one if you can't find an existing one (I don't know of one). I don't think this would quite work with all the ""identify this icon"" questions, because a lot of them are not notifications, and in some cases the questioner reports using the App info feature without much success - for example if it's a system app with an esoteric name. For those questions, I'd encourage questioners to put as much as possible into the question title and body as possible, to make it easier to find the question in searches, and to recognise it as relevant in Related questions lists. To be more specific, taking examples from your screenshot: What notification icon is this fish? That seems very good: ""fish"" is an obvious search term, and if you're starting from a picture of a fish and you see this question title, you might guess it's about your icon. What does this app Icon mean? This is a bad title. It doesn't have enough information to distinguish it from another icon identification question. When you find questions like this, please go ahead and edit them to be more descriptive."
58,"I like ""Android-2.2-Froyo"".   ""Android"" because there may be tags related to specific app versions; both ""2.2"" and ""Froyo"" because not everyone knows the code names (ref at least one question already asked on that topic)."
2182,"No. That's still a ""list question"". There could be a dozen apps that do that. Which one is the ""right"" app? If you have a specific use case and platform criteria, your question should be okay at Software Recommendations. I currently see well over 900 questions there tagged android."
