2036,"I wouldn't say ""nothing relevant in common"" as Matthew put it (especially with MTK, which has its specifics). But what I agree with: This site is for end-users, and the majority of end-users probably has no clue whether their device features a mt6582 or rk3066 chip – and if they do, they can specify such in the question's text. A tag is not very useful if ignored by the majority even if it would fit – so I agree with Matthew we don't want/need those on an end-user site (it would look different if we were a techie-centric site, sure)."
1492,"I don't think app recommendations should be a separate close reason. We turn away app recommendations for two reasons: If the question falls under 1, then we have the new ""opinion-based"" close reason to deal with it. If it falls under 2, then we have the new reason ""too broad"". If the question isn't opinion-based, and doesn't need a list, then why are we closing it? IMO we already have a problem with people flagging or VTCing questions that describe the problem the questioner wants solved and then end with, ""Is there an app that can do that?"" Adding an ""app recommendation"" close reason will, I think, encourage the knee-jerk reaction. I'd rather see flaggers and VTCers (and commenters) think about what's actually wrong with a question before hitting the button."
549,"The old way, today not functioning any more: Just append ""mobile/on"" to the base URL of the SE site you want to have mobile skin re-enabled The new and official way as it is today: click on the link ""mobile"" in the footer of the page"
1145,"Since circa 2011 all of the Stack Exchange sites have mobile-optimized versions. If you're stuck in the desktop version you can force yourself into the mobile version by clicking the ""mobile"" link at the bottom of the page. Conversely, if you find yourself in the mobile version and want to force your browser back to the desktop version, click the ""full site"" link at the bottom of the page. The site should be able to work it out from your user-agent, though."
264,"I definitely see now why it makes sense not to do this kind of tagging -- clicking the tag will show you all the questions where the user has Device X, when you really want to see all the questions about Device X. That said, many questions need device and OS info, and the tags are a convenient place to put it, for consistency reasons.  The information is always in the same place and clearly distinct from the question, so the potential answerer doesn't have to search the question for it (or remember it all as they read the question). I think the optimal solution would be to have separate fields for device and OS version that the asker could fill in if it's relevant.  The info could be shown in a separate box or something at the end of the question.  I'm not sure how much work this would be for the SE people or if it's desirable to modify this site / some sites this way, since it's clearly not applicable across the board.  Perhaps instead the FAQ could show a standard template that people should insert at the end of their question, something like:"
173,"While that's pretty cool, AppBrain is not the only market out there, and it is a for-profit venture. I think it's fine for users to link to wherever they want, I don't think the site itself should be seen as giving any site preferential treatment. If we add markup for AppBrain to the editor, we'd have to add markup for all other sites, as well. Not unless there's some form of kickback for the moderators, that is! I'd like a Nexus One and a 32GB SD card, please. At any rate, I don't think that we can customize an individual SE site at that level."
311,"I don't think that's necessary. For one thing it's not a change that would be all that universal. What use would, say, English.SE have for QR codes? Besides, the new web market puts QR codes right on the page. It's only a couple of clicks to get the URL for the image and add it to a message. "
1973,"After discussing with two to three people and posting this type of question, I found that  No one has any objection on these type of question.  Since it is not possible for all to know about the file standard of android these type of questions will be helpful for people like me. I wanted to know where the saved wifi-passwords are stored and I got an answer from this SE site and therefore I wanted to know about the other files stores in same directory as that of the file which contained the saved wifi passwords.  So this type of questions can be helpful this way. Best Regards, Jasser"
2379,"The post that you wanted to edit looked like this: This is what I got so far, it might not be the most efficient way to do it.  pm list packages >/storage/emulated/0/Apps.txt
  diff --unchanged-line-format= --old-line-format= --new-line-format='%L' /storage/emulated/0/BaselineApps.txt /storage/emulated/0/Apps.txt | sed 's/^[^:]*://' >/storage/emulated/0/NewApps.txt I suggest, instead of using whitespaces in every line, use &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;/pre&gt; at the beginning of first line and end of last line. E.g.  &lt;pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt; If you're editing the text which falls between a list, simply add one whitespace before &lt;pre&gt; to align the whole preformatted text with the list. E.g. This is what I got so far, it might not be the most efficient way to do it. "
1121,I just want to add to Matthew's answer that I think that the confusion comes with the fact that it's hard for the average user to distinguish between an Activity and a Service running in background. We have two questions Both a very similar. Yet there are not really exact duplicates. That is why my solution would be to reopen the first question of type 2 and close either this one or Scott's question as duplicate and merge the answer(s).
