1490,"I think it might be beneficial to make the wording of the first one more broadly applicable than just ""software development questions"". Something like: Questions about writing and publishing Android apps, writing custom ROMs, and other topics that are primarily of concern to developers are off-topic. Consider taking advantage of other resources that may be appropriate for your question. The reason I'm inclined to link to Where can I ask questions that aren&#39;t Android Enthusiast questions? instead of SO directly is that there are things in that statement (publishing and such) that SO would likely close as well."
39,"I totally thought the same thing about the 'android-app' tag being redundant. We should choose which one is the ""authoritative"" tag and edit all the questions to use that one.  I vote we use ""applications"". (Is there a way to blacklist tags?)"
1329,I'd like to hear other opinions too but my stance is that it's ok. Especially since you are an (active) member of the site and sure going to watch the ankidroid tag.  I'd like to make it clear that it's was 100% correct to ask first. Android Enthusiasts should not become a support/discussion forum for the various Android Apps out there if they Apps have a dedicated forum or help site. The question that remains is: Does AE.SX become a second place for Ankidroid support or are you going to close/archive the Google Group?
1084,I'd like to ask for opinions about the following idea: ATM is not possible to see if a question that is taged application was already reviewed. Therefore my motivation to review the application tag is very low. I suggest we retag every question that has been reviewed either with a more approbiate application tag or rename application to android-application. If the application count is zero android-application can become application again.
69,"This is a dedicated android site. 
Any tag that would NOT have ""android"" in it is on the wrong site.
Any tag that explicitly has ""android"" in it is redundant. As an Android site, the un-qualified version# of Android is a legitimate tag.
As an Android site, the un-qualified version# of a random application is not a legitimate tag (and would only be so on a site dedicated to that application). [2.2] or [Froyo] s/b fine."
1516,"This is quite possibly my fault (though the system should probably handle it better). At the end of last week How do you link to applications in the Android market? came up in my Close Votes queue as a dupe of How to post a link to an android market app? but after looking at the two questions, it was obvious that one had old, out-of-date and (now-)incorrect answers (one answer was by me) whereas the other one had answers that are current and correct. In my opinion the Close As Dupe vote had been cast on the wrong question (based on which one had the currently good answers) so I ""Leave Open"" voted the one and I submitted the first VtC on the other. Having explained what I did though, the system really should show what's going on in a clearer manner, and handle the situation where one is Closed as a Dupe while the other is still in the vote to close phase."
1588,"My opinion is that questions which are purely about gameplay (""How do I beat level 5 in Inexplicably Popular Social Game-of-the-Month?"") should go to Arqade. They simply aren't about Android the OS, even if the title is platform exclusive. Configuring hardware or something to work with a game could be OS dependent - something like ""How can I set up a Bluetooth controller for my Android device?"" as an example - and those seem okay, but gameplay questions should be directed to...well, gamers. We may have gamers here, but it's just not our purpose."
1330,"Is it a good idea? Yes and no. StackExchange is application-neutral, so unlike support in your own forum, people may and will recommend to use another app instead of yours even if the question title contained your application specifically. Therefore, questions that refers to a specific application may be generalized so it may be answerable with other applications.  Are there metrics about when it makes sense to redirect user questions to Android Enthusiasts? Although the ""too localized"" criteria is sometimes applied quite inconsistently, it still applies that if a question is written in a way such that only the Original Poster can benefit from the question, then it is going to be closed. Questions in StackExchange have to satisfy the criteria of applicability to a more general audience. Also, we generally frown against questions that requires specific expertise in a specific application because we do not have the necessary expertise to answer the application. Redirecting user supports to this site would only work if you also redirect application-specific experts to this site. Finally, the QA format of StackExchange is not suitable for extended discussion. If a troubleshooting requires extended back and forth discussion, then this is not the right place to do so. If a question needs extended discussion, you are certainly welcome to do it on Google Groups and then write a self-answered question that summarizes the discussion (after tidying up the unrelated discussions). If these seems acceptable to you, I don't see any reason why you should not redirect users here for support questions."
356,"This is very similar to a shopping recommendation and much of the same advice applies.  Beyond that, consider: you have created an ""infinite list of X"" question. Surely there is (probably) an Android equivalent for every single iPhone app? the equivalents, even if valid now, may change over time; apps change over time. The value of this list will be highly limited as it ages. Perhaps if you had specific things you were looking for Android equivalents to on iPhone -- like the built in default applications. But scoping it to ""any app that can ever be, or will ever be"" just doesn't work."
1066,"I am undecided. This are two different things, although there are  very few  questions. I would let them separated for a while and see how things go."
