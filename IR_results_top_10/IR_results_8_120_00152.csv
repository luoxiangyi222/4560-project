818,We definitely can't reproduce this. Did you try disabling any Chrome extensions you are using? Did you modify any of the default browser settings?
171,"I'm trying to add this to (regular, non-hosted) gmail. I haven't added a lot of widgets, and I'm stumped the gadget URL is  It shows up, but is empty  and the gadgets settings tells me I need to configure an ID (of course)... but I can't find a way to configure the ID.  Does this not work for gmail -- which otherwise accepts gadgets --, or can I configure it?"
1026,"I'd like to add this thought, as per the linky in the above comment, I did think the question was rogue, but who am I to judge?! I could be very well wrong on that type of question asked, and my thinking was ""Was that a very deceptive social-engineering ploy to extract information?"" but I digress. Obviously, the line needs to be drawn, perhaps, by limiting the answer to those type of questions with a certain reputation level maybe? i.e. if the question posed, is of a nature where it elicits an answer that involves a form of hacking or exploiting the handset, whether benign intentions or unintentional (as in ""Whoops I fouled up and now I cannot get into my handset""), a reputation of say 5,000 can view the answer as a result of gaining that level of trust by the community! But on the other hand, if an answer is posted for all to see, it WILL be abused and misused for whatever exploitation techniques regardlessly for whatever reasons that would be outside of the domain of the community.  That question, meanwhile was bizarre to say the least! But refrained from answering publicly in case it turns out to be false, i.e. Was it a stolen handset and that the OP was trying to extract data from it but then again, the OP did dodge it by back-tracking over the gmail and switched tactics about yahoo mail hence the comments in the said question.

2051,"To enable better aspect ratios than that offered by Imgur's black magic offered in the previous answer, you could try using HTML tags like: I personally prefer this as the Imgur URL modifications mentioned above sometimes badly mess up aspect ratios of screenshots. This entails more effort than a modified link, but produces better results."
212,"The search engine answer seems the most likely. I know that when I've done a quick Google on answers for some of the slightly obscure questions here, the question itself often shows up in the top 5 Google results. Also, have a look at the questions with the most views, like the Galaxy S GPS problems one. These have thousands of views, and lots of replies from users with just one rep point, that smacks of people who've just found the page through a search engine when they're trying to find the solution to a problem they're having, but aren't sticking around and using the rest of the site."
917,"The best you can really do currently is to create a new room and then invite the user to that room. You can also leave a link to the room as a comment on their post if you want. The automated chat link will also create a public room, so from that regard it's essentially the same (and you can give it whatever title you want). One downside is that the auto-inserted link will import the comments from the post into the chat room when it's created. Creating your own room beforehand will not do this, but if you are pre-emptively setting up a chat with someone then there is likely not going to be a long comment thread to import anyway, I'd imagine. This has also been discussed on Meta Stack Overflow."
985,"I do agree that a little improvement needs to be performed on some of the lightest grey's used. I mainly use Firefox 13.0.1 under Ubuntu 12.04, and with my recently acquired ASUS VE228 LED Monitor, I have some trouble recognizing some of the lightest grey colors currently being used. Using Firebug, I've analyzed and collected some information regarding tags or classes that apply a light grey as a background color for a visual representation: #F4F4F4 is hard to see .post-tag class currently using #F4F4F4 This class is used on on regular tags. e.g., hard-to-see #F3F3F3 is hard to see code tag currently using #F3F3F3  This tag is used on inline code, when we wrap something around a `. e.g., I'm inline highlighted code pre tag currently using #F3F3F3 This tag is used when we either press ctrl + k or use the toolbar button . e.g., #F6F6F6 is hard to see, with considerations .owner class currently using #F6F6F6 This class is used for the background of a users signature. Note:
Since the rectangle for a user signature has a respectable size, it's easier to notice the color difference between the white background and the signature background. #EEEEEE works very well blockquote tag currently using #EEEEEE This tag is used when we either press ctrl + q or use the toolbar button . e.g., I'm a quote block In order to properly understand if this was an issue of my newly acquired monitor, or a overall situation, I've performed some tests (opening and navigating the  page) using difference OSâ€™s and monitors. Here's the conclusions: Windows XP Professional Version 2002 SP3 | ASUS VE228 LED Monitor Browsers used: Result obtained: equal results on all browsers My conclusion for the tests performed is that under optimal color calibration conditions, the light grey's used are hard to distinguish from the white background. It gets really hard when we're reading a paragraph with some inline code, because at first glance I can't spot it. The code-block fails only if we are reading a single line of code. When two or more lines are used, it is reasonable visible, just like the background color for the user signature. Windows 7 Home Edition SP1 | Toshiba Laptop - Satellite C660 (built-in monitor) Browsers used: Result obtained: equal results on all browsers My Toshiba doesn't have any color calibration applied, since I don't perform any graphical design with it. The sole purpose for this laptop is the test of work being developed, just like a client would see it, so, everything is by default across the system. Here, It appears to work well on all browsers on all colors tested. Naturally that the light grey is more like a blueish color than actually a tone from black-to-white. So I can't really rely on this as to a positive assessment, I'll consider it a false-positive. Every grey color currently used below the tone provided by #EEEEEE can't stand out if used on small areas. Some improvements are noted if used of considerably large areas. The #EEEEEE works well for calibrated an non calibrated working environments. Have the following colors updated to a slightly dark tone: This assessment was performed with a Linux tool called Agave. I've used the tool color piker and picked the colors from examples provided on this answer. Then, I've lowered the tone by one, and the result provided was far more visible then the one picked.  HTML color code is placed on the lower right side of the color rectangle Using Agave color picker on this image, I did get the correct code for each rectangle picked. There seems to be no distinction between the colors in use or proposed colors when placed side by side respectively. All three used colors side by side are visually equal. Same goes for the ones suggested. As a side note: one may consider using just one color to replace the three being used."
1210,"When you see a post here on meta titled ""2012 Community Moderator Election Results"" you'll be able to read it and know what the results were. That'll usually happen somewhere between 10 minutes and 24 hours after the election ends.  Of course, someone will probably post the results in chat between 10 and 24 seconds after the election ends. But if that's still not quick enough for you, you can download the OpenSTV software and election data and run it yourself (both will be linked to on the election page immediately after the election ends). How long that takes is up to you. "
527,"Since the more a site or page gets +1 clicks the higher it appears in Google's search results Er.. this isn't true, and if it was there would be, as Robocop once said, ""problems"". These +1s are intimately tied to Social Search, that is, if Google knows who you are and your friend network, those results might be escalated for you only: "
399,"My part in that conversation started because travis said that his phone had the same problem as the OP's, so at first I was trying to find a common thread between their two devices. If they were both running ROMs running Sense UI that would suggest that perhaps it wasn't necessarily a hardware-specific issue and those of us trying to help should focus more on their particular firmwares and not just the phones themselves.  When travis said he didn't know I wanted to try to be clear when explaining to him what he needed to know in order to give me a useful answer. I hope that clarifies my seemingly off-topic comments.  :)"
