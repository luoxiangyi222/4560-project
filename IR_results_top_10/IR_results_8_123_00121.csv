1264,"I see no problem with editing ""wifi"" into ""Wi-Fi"".  If it changes search results then that should probably be brought up with SE ... hyphens should not be considered for web search IMO. However, edits should always be substantial.  If that was the only change then it was a bad edit.  See "
2119,"There's a post with the details on the SE Meta site. As far as the badges go, they are: There is a SEDE query that will calculate your current score without having to actually submit a nomination."
841,"I think you're seeing one of two behaviours that changed recently with @replies. Essentially the @reply isn't auto-completed (and is often removed when you post) if there is only one possible, unmistakable person who's the target of your post and so your @name bit would be redundant. So if you're making a comment on a question that has no answers, and it's the very first comment, then you are obviously making a comment to the questioner, so adding @name is redundant. The other thing that's changed is that when SE thinks that two people are having a conversation (when there's only two of you commenting and you're going back and forth between you) then the @name is removed too, as it's obvious who you're talking to. In these cases even though there's no @name in your comment, because it's obvious who you're talking to the person that you're talking to will still get notified that you're talking to them (for instance question askers are always notified when someone comments on their question with @naming anyone else)."
2397,"Related question Adding a template question to the Ask Question box. Perhaps such changes are not possible unless it's a global change across all SE sites Questions having the phrase I am working on app or similar need not be developer oriented. That could be the reason for asking but the question may not be off topic. For instance, in this question , if OP had said he was developing an app for that device and wanted to know the path, it wouldn't make it off topic Copy full system and data partitions of Oneplus 3T to computer or a better example How can I do development on my Android device? OP's are expected to search for relevant tags and if their question is related to development use development and if they bother to read to read the tag wiki , they would know not to ask (too much to expect, going by experience). See Does [tag:development] mean &quot;Asking for closure&quot;? I fully endorse that questions having code should raise a flag but it is related to the first bullet point and would like this to be implemented ASAP. Perhaps , moderators here could take this up Edit: Discovered this question on Meta.SE asked years before Revisiting question templates"
118,"We should email a some of the big Android Blogs an let them know about Android.SE, invite them to join and share their expertise and encourage them to share it as a resource to their readers.  I was going to just do it but maybe we should discuss a game plan. These are the android sites I frequent:"
311,"I don't think that's necessary. For one thing it's not a change that would be all that universal. What use would, say, English.SE have for QR codes? Besides, the new web market puts QR codes right on the page. It's only a couple of clicks to get the URL for the image and add it to a message. "
2323,"What's the intent of OP? ...Changing the date and time in the phone can ""evade"" the version and trial and continue to use it Further, they want to know .... if it was possible to change the date of a single app even by changing the source code of 'App To my mind, there is no ambiguity around that Is it legal ? - we are not equipped to discuss Is it ethical ? To me clearly, NO Could OP have other valid reasons for asking , which might have triggered this question ? - possible,  but if not stated, let's not assume either ways but go by what's presented ( also note that there was no response to my first comment, stating that it is unethical ) Should we permit such questions (not withstanding the fact that a diligent search on Internet would reveal ways and means ) ?? Emphatic NO"
138,"Another thought: I alway link to Appbrain for apps and I'm not going to stop doing that but if you find a solution on another website like Lifehacker, putting a link to the article would be a good idea.  If those sites start getting referrals from android.SE and/or see the back links they may take notice quicker.  "
2232,"I don't know if there is general SE guidance on this, but I would say yes &mdash; clear cut cases seem like a good place for flags.  This site is not at the point where moderators need to heavily triage flags, as yet.  That said, I also go fully through most queues regularly, so a flag is not strictly necessary."
351,"Indeed, anyone can propose edits to a question or answer. For those with insufficient privileges to edit outright, these proposed changes go into a queue that is visible to users with 10,000 reputation (or more) and moderators. These users can inspect the change and approve it, reject it, or delete the entire post. If approved, the person suggesting the edits gets 2 reputation points. You can earn up to 1,000 reputation points through suggesting edits; of course once you reach 2,000 points you can edit without prior approval. (Note, of course, that all edits are recorded and can be rolled back if necessary.) When you edit someone else's question or answer, keep these things in mind: However, and more importantly... In other words, your edits should change the readability of the post, not the content. Otherwise, leave a comment."
