860,This if fine by me. Martin covers all the points I was going to say. Pass on over the good questions. :)
138,"Another thought: I alway link to Appbrain for apps and I'm not going to stop doing that but if you find a solution on another website like Lifehacker, putting a link to the article would be a good idea.  If those sites start getting referrals from android.SE and/or see the back links they may take notice quicker.  "
1152,"Yes, why not. There's no reason why we shouldn't opt-in. If Android likes to be cool, why its Enthusiasts can't. Go for it without turning back..."
29,"I think a lot of good points have already been made here but after taking a look at the existing questions, I really think people need to take a good hard look at this: Edit - I missed a few, and more just keep coming and coming... Guys, this is seriously awful.  We are just one day into the beta and out of 109 questions on the site, 22 of them (over 20%) are about which apps are ""good/bad/best"" - yikes! Worse, almost none of them are Community Wiki, so people are actually gaining rep for asking and answering the most mundane and subjective questions imaginable. I think this list very dramatically illustrates the problem with allowing these questions.  There's no end to them.  What's the best compass app?  What's the best flashlight app?  What's the best ukelele simulation app?  Gah! Is this what we're going to be, just a glorified review site?  Is it really that hard to just go to the market and read the reviews?  The Android developers have already built us this beautiful rating and review system that you can access right on your phone.  We don't need this fluff. Please, please, let's start closing these questions.  At the very least close them until we have moderators who can properly wikify them, but even then, I don't want to see people's 1-line recommendations taking up 20% of the site.  This is turning into a land grab with everybody wanting to own one of the big bad 500+ upvoted poll questions.  If we don't nip this in the bud, it's going to bite us hard later on. P.S. I'm not saying every question about an app is bad.  Here are two that are fine: In the first example, somebody is looking for a very specific app and has provided criteria to significantly narrow down the list of candidates.  In the second example, the author is asking for a comparison of two specific apps.  I see no problem with either of these. I just don't want to see two hundred ""Post your favourite [X] app"" polls by the time we hit public beta."
699,"In going back through the unanswered questions, the following twelve seemed to be more likely to garner a response or interest from average user types.  "
697,"I really like the idea, I think there are a lot!! Here there are some of them: Block all sounds going out through speaker when headphone connected How can I fix the WiFi button or prevent WiFi errors when turning it off and back on?"
1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
1597,"Scripts can have accounts too. It would be easy for a spammer or other malicious user to sign in and then give control to his script. Having the possibility of a CAPTCHA for signed-in users prevents this attack. The system has a few ways to guess whether particular activity is from a genuine user. Full details aren't available to us end-users, because that would make the system too easy for attackers to defeat. One common way to make the check go wrong is to leave a page open for a long time before submitting the form; for example, you start to answer a question, then get interrupted, go to lunch, come back an hour later, finish answering the question, and then get the CAPTCHA when you try to post your answer. This is because of a token in the page that expires after some time."
2112,"Even though we've a clear consensus on Should users (non-Moderators) approve an edit made by a user posing as the author of the post? you can still find two or three regular reviewers who do not go by that consensus and wrongly approve such edits.  Other problem is with reviewing where careless or superfluous edits gets approved, most likely to increase review count. How do you deal with such reviewers or with their reviewing? If you don't see a problem, please tell us why do you not find such reviews a problem at all. "
2035,"What is the actual use in grouping phones by chipset?  This site is for end-users, there is going to be virtually nothing relevant in common between two phones from different manufacturers than both happen to include MediaTek chips."
