783,"Sounds good to me, and I agree that individual requests are basically shopping recs.  I went ahead and created the question: Where can I find stock or custom ROMs for my Android device?"
334,"I think the question to ask is, can this be generalized to help others in the future, and if so, how much? Otherwise it's basically a shopping question: "
456,"Given Jeff's answer &amp; response to my comment, and the fact that I can't see that any of our tag wikis currently ""Provide basic guidance on when to use the tag"" (though they do define what the tag means), I'd suggest we start with this. The Device/OS tags are a great example - can we first define when it is appropriate/useful to apply these tags, add some guidance to the tag wikis and see if that makes any difference?"
400,"It is, basically, a measure of how trustworthy your ""flags"" are. That is, what priority posts get when you flag them for moderator attention. The higher the number, the greater weight your flags are given. FAQ: What is 'flag weight'?"
972,"Both underscores and asterisks work for italics, it has nothing at all to do with the button.  Basically you've confused the parser that converts the Markdown to HTML. You have to escape the underscore with a backslash: *kernel\_config.gz* Which shows as: kernel_config.gz"
2015,"As already mentioned on Matthew's comment, ""How to use the limited set of operations provided by a particular app to calculate arcsin"" is a math question. Everything you just described is about math. If you want a calculator app with more operations then you should use one. Basically, the issues are: The first question is a legit question and actually answerable (answer: there's no operator to do that, install 3rd-party calculator instead).  However, you dragged our attention to the second question, which is unclear and off-topic:"
1242,"Ideally, there would be a separate answer for the different build. However, I think it's not unreasonable to leave both questions open. The questions have a clear difference, even if it's only slight. If it turns out that the answer to both are basically the same, they can always be merged later. It would be good to put explicit links between them, as well as some language saying why they're not duplicates. (Close-as-duplicate is more for situations where you have ""How do I make the turtle move in Logo?"" and ""In Logo, how do I move the turtle?"" questions, which are obviously just different phrasings of the same question.)"
1162,The flavor of Markdown that Stack Exchange uses doesn't support this. I would be against it in any case. Underlines are very commonly understood to indicate links when on web sites. You mess with this very basic and well-understood UI element at your peril. (I can't tell you how many times I've been on some web site and tried to click underlined text and nothing happened.) See also: Why can we format text with bold and italic but not underline? It's been brought up before and unless you can devise a compelling new argument it's not going to be implemented.
718,"It might be valuable to expand our current question to include version numbers.  The ""gingerbreak"" exploit has been fixed in newer versions of 2.3, for example. I think having a separate question for each device would get out of hand, however.  That list has 50ish devices, which would basically mean 50 times the upkeep if they were split up.  I do understand your point about voting, but I think the community can be trusted to remove terrible instructions, add disclaimers, and add newer/better instructions. If there are unique circumstances, e.g., something that should work for your device and version does not or softbricks your device or something, you can absolutely ask a separate question about that.  So far the wiki has been pretty useful in keeping all of the basic questions from cluttering the site and being harder to find, though -- there are 69 dupes. Several of us who are familiar with XDA and other sites frequent the chat room.  I and I'm sure others would gladly try to help you find the info you're looking for if you give us the details.  The other method to try to solicit this information is through a bounty on the wiki question stating what you need. As for the problem at hand: Have you tried following the guides listed at the top of this XDA thread?  In particular, some variant of Koush's (flashing recovery and then a rooting package or a rooted ROM) should work regardless of your software version, since the Nexus S has an unlockable bootloader."
192,"It's basically asking us to parse the news for the asker. As opposed to any other question that is asking us to parse [google|internet|personal experience] ? But speculative questions have no one right answer until the future is past. In that sense, they may be worse than community wiki."
