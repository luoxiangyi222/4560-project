633,"I'm getting one and hope to be asking questions here.  Bryan and GAThrawn have explained why. A minor note: Until it's actually released, I expect we won't be accepting questions about it &mdash; the only ones we could answer with certitude pertain to the information Amazon has publicly released.  Just like with Ice Cream Sandwich, we won't speculate or post answers that say ""go look at this thing Eric Schmidt / Jeff Bezos said""; premature questions generally get closed. Just something to keep in mind before you migrate :)"
311,"I don't think that's necessary. For one thing it's not a change that would be all that universal. What use would, say, English.SE have for QR codes? Besides, the new web market puts QR codes right on the page. It's only a couple of clicks to get the URL for the image and add it to a message. "
178,"I have two concerns. One, ""intrusive"" is very subjective. What's intrusive for you may not be a big deal for someone else. Second, and more important, is that I think it's too ambitious and doesn't fit in with this site. The number of tablets is going to grow exponentially and, unless someone is really dedicated, your proposed wiki will never be able to keep up. Once it gets out of date by more than a couple months, it will have lost most of its utility. Plus it has the potential to get really huge. This is the sort of thing that Wikipedia does well. Let them. "
1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
766," Al Everett answered: Heck no. That's a breach of trust.  Matthew Read answered: Absolutely not.  If the information wasn't provided in the public profile or provided directly by the person to me, then it's private.  It should only be used if necessary in the course of moderation duties and never exposed beyond the user, other mods, and the team within the appropriate contexts.  eldarerathis answered: No, I wouldn't feel at all right about doing that. I'd only ever consider contacting someone if it was through some kind of information they had chosen to make public.  Bryan Denny answered: No, I would say that is ""creepy."" If they didn't publicly share the info, then I have no reason to try and contact them (other than the rare/exceptional sending a private message procedure)  Flow answered: No, thatâ€™s not for what the tool is meant to. Especially if  the data is not public visible. "
1148,"I've re-opened it.  I don't think one person verifying that they can see the buttons is enough to say that no one else will be unable to see them, like you.  I can't think of any reason why this would be happening to you and only you, so I think it passes the ""potentially useful to others"" metric. The nature of the question obviously changed due to the comments, however &mdash; it's some combination of your account/location/environment/app version/etc. and the particular apps rather than something about the particular apps that affects everyone.  I've edited it as such, please make sure to do such editing yourself when possible.  Secondly the question would benefit from extra information, such as:"
1312,"From looking on MSO it appears that when featured expires (after a week) the tag is removed from the cached render of the post but a new revision is not created.  So when you try to edit and add it, you're actually doing nothing, hence no change to the post.  To get around this you have to change the tags, as Bryan mentioned. Still a bug."
2405,"I think it's important to look past the words the questioner happened to use, to see what the intent of the questioner is, and I wish close-voters would put a little more thought into that. This isn't 3-2-1, and you shouldn't lose everything just because you happened to use the magic word ""app"" in your question. Recommendation questions are opinion-based. They ask for lists of answers, and they tend to get spam answers as a result. The answers are less useful than Google Play search results, because they go out of date quickly. This is why we don't like them on the site. Which is the best music player? or Is there a good third-party SMS app? These are simplified examples of bad questions. What kind of answer will they get? A million answers saying ""I like such-and-such app, it's the best"" with no justification. An answer with a one-off copy-paste of Izzy's app lists, which will slowly go out of date or need editors to keep updating it over time. I have a bunch of CSV files in Google Drive and I need to download them when they change and add the results up. Is there an app for that? or I play games on my tablet with my kid ""helping"" sitting on my knee. He often grabs the rim of the tablet and pokes the volume button and makes it really loud. I need the volume buttons turned off when I'm playing a game. Is there an app for that? This doesn't seem like a ""recommendation"" question to me. What kind of answer will it get? There still might be more than one. It might say, ""Use such-and-such app, it can do this out of the box,"" but more likely, it'll say ""You have to install Pushbullet or IFTTT to find out when the file changes, then use Tasker to schedule downloading them and open Excel for Android to load the CSV files,"" or ""You need a custom ROM for this. Lineage can do it."" The difference is, you can replace ""Is there an app?"" with ""How do I solve my problem?"" without really changing the meaning of the question. In the recommendation questions, you can't do that. I think that's the crucial difference. If I find a question like this second pair of examples in the close vote queue, I'll typically make that edit so that people don't close the question, but I don't think the edit should be needed. Just because someone thought an app is the most likely solution to their problem, that doesn't turn a good problem-solving question into a recommendation question. I think we should all apply that test in our head: can I replace ""is there an app?"" with ""is there a solution?"" without changing the meaning of the question."
820,"5 questions isn't much to go by statistically, besides that 2 of the unanswered ones are from shortly before Christmas and the other from yesterday.  Two of them seem fairly obscure as well, so the whole I wouldn't be surprised.  Feel free to edit the older ones (ideally improving them) to bump them to the top of the Active list. Our unanswered question rate is 15% with SO at 19%. I would have expected it to be higher than SO (we do get a lot of obscure questions), but I would agree it does seem a bit high regardless.  Our answer rate is not as high as it was during Beta, either. While I would say the site is ""active"", it's not perfect.  We discussed some of the site's issues before here.  If you have any ideas on how to address any of this, please share them."
1222,"Ok, now I have got over losing (I think), time for this. I just wanted to personally thank everyone that took part and voted, and also every one of the 16 people that chose me as their preferred candidate. If we ever have another election, then maybe I can win this time - maybe more people will vote for me. Congratulations to the two winners, Flow and onik - well done :) If I ever get caught up in my thoughts again, direct me to this post please - and thanks to Izzy for calming me down Yesterday on the chat :) You never know - maybe two moderators will drop out for some reason and I will get instated ;) Just let me say thanks to everyone involved - and congrats to the winners."
