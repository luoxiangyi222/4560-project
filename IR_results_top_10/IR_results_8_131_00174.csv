687,"I think only #2 is acceptable, though it might be closed as a dupe.  #1 and #5 are way too subjective, #3 is an off-topic shopping advice question, and #4 isn't a question :P.  (Note we don't take speculative questions either, which applies to most questions about 4.0 and the Fire right now.) If a contest wants to use questions here I think they still need to be real questions, real problems, asked and answerable from a user's perspective."
403,"In this case I do think the tag should have stayed.  But Al is right that we have way too many questions tagged with the device for no real reason.  If you're not sure if it's relevant, just mention your device in the question and leave off the tags.  See also: Should we discourage phone model tags in non-phone-specific questions?"
1241,"It's a problem all over, not just here. Not five minutes ago I voted to close a programming question on Web Applications. And how about all of the ""how do I fix this non-programming Android issue"" questions that have been closed on Stack Overflow? (And believe me, there have been a lot more of them than development questions here.) There are any number of helpful hints to guide potential Askers to the right place. You probably don't remember because you've been around for a while, but there's a dialog that new users need to click through before posting that says basically: I have read what this site is about, I see it again here right in front of me, and this is the right place, so let me ask my question. There's the FAQ, of course. And the ""Ask Question"" page does give guidance, at least until your reputation meets a certain threshold. The problem, and it's not limited to here, is that people don't read on the Web. The only thing that keeps sites on topic is swift, efficient, ruthless moderation when people post off-topic stuff. (Remember Usenet?) That's because people will post off-topic stuff; it can't be stopped. Don't forget, we also have the development tag, which has been left on here as kind of a ""honeypot"" to make it easier to find off-topic questions. (The assumption being, of course, that anyone doing development would see that tag and use it, in spite of the tag wiki excerpt explicitly saying that such questions are off-topic.) Unfortunately, the applications tag (which is terribly misused and abused and is in dire need of cleanup) is almost always one of the sample tags suggested and, since they're developing an application, must be the tag they want, right? So, yes, it's annoying and I wish these people would get a clue. Don't worry about the Moderators' time, though. We don't need to waste it with simple stuff like this. Just continue to vote to close. Downvote them for wasting your time. (Enough downvotes&mdash;six, I believe&mdash;and the question drops off the front page.) If you're feeling kind, point them to the FAQ. But you should probably resign yourself to the fact that no matter how many clues and help and speed bumps we put in front of new users (and there are quite a few), some people are going to post off-topic stuff. All we can hope to do is educate them, hopefully educate people who see their off-topic question and so won't repeat the mistake, and close them down without mercy."
1517,"Placing a comment on the question that is going to cause a dup cycle is the right thing to do. Hopefully users working on the review queue will notice the comment and choose the right action (e.g. Leave Open). I also just noticed that the system prevents duplicate cycles (not sure if only direct cycles or also deeper ones). If the cycle has already been established, the you should flag for mod attention and/or cast reopen votes."
2609,"If you are having a problem in performing a task with an app, you can seek help on our main site. It is within the scope of our main site. Per What topics can I ask about here? in Help Center: If your question generally covers... then this is the right place to ask. Basically, what problem (with your Android device) are you trying to solve? (Emphasis mine)"
1317,"You can use some of the advanced search parameters to do this, but I don't think there's a simple link anywhere. The search would be: Which gives you these results. You can expand the ""Advanced Search Tips"" link on the right side of the search page to see other available operators."
1484,"Topics related to users using the Play Store and problems using the Play Store are already on topic, there's lots of them in the google-play-store tag. It's just questions from a developer's perspective that are off-topic, and I think that's still the right distinction."
2182,"No. That's still a ""list question"". There could be a dozen apps that do that. Which one is the ""right"" app? If you have a specific use case and platform criteria, your question should be okay at Software Recommendations. I currently see well over 900 questions there tagged android."
1823,"Flagging as spam is correct in this case, IMO. The answer doesn't answer the question, even though it's relevant. It's a half-apology (&quot;we're sorry this happens sometimes, but we're not going to help&quot;) combined with an advert (&quot;so would you like to look at some of our products&quot;). I note that this answer has already been removed as spam, so you clearly weren't the only person to think this was the best response. The poster is free to write a new answer if they're going to answer the question this time. I think there are a few related cases (similar possible answers) that are worth discussing. I'm sorry to hear about that. It's not possible to solve that problem with that product alone, but we also sell another product/an upgrade, at  I think an answer like this would pretty clearly be included in our policy that promotional content is OK so long as there is disclosure and it's relevant to the question. In fact, I'd say this is still a good answer, even if the original question was about a competing product from another vendor, so long as the product being recommended solves the problem. I'm sorry to hear you've had trouble. Because our awesome product is so flexible, you can solve the problem by ... By the way, you might like to see our other products at  Here the promotional content isn't relevant to the question, which is a bit spammy. The rest of the answer is relevant. In a case like this, I think I'd be tempted to just edit out the spammy content, with a helpful edit remark like, &quot;This part of your post isn't relevant to the question. I've removed it to make sure your post isn't removed as spam.&quot; Note that normally one shouldn't edit out spam links (or other spam content) from posts; it's just that in this case it's probably just a helpful answerer who doesn't understand the community's expectations.

Somecompany: the best Android software ever  In this case, it's pretty clearly just an email signature the support staff thought it would be a good idea to include. We often get people including signatures in posts, and the recommended response is to just edit it out. You can use the edit message to suggest that they include the link &amp; signature content in their user profile. As above, the intent probably wasn't to spam, it's just ignorance of what's expected."
1290,"There are two ways to generally ask questions of this nature. The Good and the Bad.   These questions are not useful to the general community and lead to ""fluffy"" link-only fodder answers. They really don't solve any problems (the main focus of any site) and it is hard to filter what is good and what isn't when there are 10+ answers all at the same rough vote count.   First of all: Do your research. Have you thoroughly searched for an answer? Have you searched in the Play Store? Do you even have a real problem you need to solve? And if so, have you attempted to solve the problem yourself? Instead of assuming a solution, ask about your problem instead. If you did your research and you can describe what the problem is, then here's how to ask: Questions like these are problem-based, and lead to useful answers. See also:"
