178,"I have two concerns. One, ""intrusive"" is very subjective. What's intrusive for you may not be a big deal for someone else. Second, and more important, is that I think it's too ambitious and doesn't fit in with this site. The number of tablets is going to grow exponentially and, unless someone is really dedicated, your proposed wiki will never be able to keep up. Once it gets out of date by more than a couple months, it will have lost most of its utility. Plus it has the potential to get really huge. This is the sort of thing that Wikipedia does well. Let them. "
671,"Well, the title pretty much says it all, is it a good idea to create this in advance to reduce a flood of similar questions?"
134,"Well, you can tether via USB or bluetooth.  But with separate [wifi] (or [usb] or [bluetooth]) and [tether] tags, that should get the point across"
90,You start with 1 reputation point. If you link your user account to an account on another Stack Exchange site you get a free 100 point bonus. Thus 101 reputation without asking any questions or giving any answers. Update: Note that the account you link to has to have a minimum amount of reputation itself (200+) or you don't get the bonus. The thinking is that if you're a good contributor on another site that will likely be true on this one as well.  Linked account didn&#39;t get 100 rep points
2001,"Here is the breakdown: You had 1+5+2=8 points until an hour ago.      Then you received a downvote on a post of yours which took two points out of the total, ending up at 6 points.  Now, you pretty much had it all figured out, but you're missing the point stated in help center here: (Emphasis mine) This is simply what happened. You received a single downvote (that -1 between the arrows) on your answer which took away  two points from your account and one point from the user who downvoted it."
1028,"The interesting thing is how many questions of this kind are asked by first-timers (feels like 95% up). It's rarely one with rep coming up with such a question. Next interesting fact is how often the OP shows up afterwards: I'd say 80% up do never show up again, 10% just on the very first day to prove their point and destroy doubts, if possible. Which makes it quite suspicious. Don't take me wrong: The information is freely available if you know the sources, you don't even have to identify yourself to get it. That's why I'd say ""big fish"" never turns up like that (""big fish"" not only knows where the food is, but also ""how to get the crab out of its shell""). So what's left must be either ""small fish"" (those who just ""found"" a single device -- which is not worth the big research and maybe little to big monetary investment), and people of ""legitimate interest"". Not being interested in the former, this leaves the latter. Who are they? People like t0mm13b, who are simply technically interested, or willing to help ""friends in need"" (i.e. people they know). These usually already have a higher rep -- and I see no reason to hide things from them. But then there's the last remaining group: those without any rep, who just f***ed off their device (in this case -- call me bad -- it's a good point to start learning not to fiddle with things you don't understand -- or to be more careful with your sensitive stuff, sorry), or in fact had ""bad stuff happening"" (the brothers little daughter playing with the... how did she get her hands on it?). So my opinion on this: I go with t0mm13b. If technically possible, real sensitive stuff should require a certain rep (at least 1,000+). Everybody below that level could still get the ""obvious legitimate solutions"", such as to specify their Google credentials on a messed-up pattern lock, or see their local Rabbi1... oops, service technician. If it's really your device, you have the papers to prove -- and the solution to your problem is reached faster when taking those papers and looking up a service point (you can return successfully just within minutes) but to prove the legitimacy to ""us"". If it's really a legitimate thing, (s)he will do so. For a petty thief, even this little effort will be too much -- and if it requires more afford, (s)he probably doesn't find it as worth the next time. 1SYLOR is the term for getting sensitive information on e.g. our judaism stack (See Your Local Orthodox Rabbi. Meaning: This is real sensitive (and maybe personal) stuff which should be explained by an expert face-to-face: He can identify you and tell you what you really should know -- as opposed to what you say you need to know -- guess you get my point."
896,"Well, you know, there are such things as on-topic questions that no one can answer. Or, more accurately, the person who can answer just hasn't visited the site. A well-written question with the right keywords will certainly draw websearch traffic, so it's only a matter of time until we get an answer (we hope). On the other hand, dozens of ""how do I install OS (x) on device (y)"" won't be helpful. A canonical question to trap them all would be good."
2005,"IMHO we don't need a separate tag for that, as customization (which we already have) covers that perfectly. For ease of transition, we might consider creating personalization as synonym to this – which also had the pro guiding people looking for the right tag, but not as a separate tag. Our tags do not resemble categories in Google Playstore (one could also point at Google asking to create a ""custom-rom"", ""rooting"", or ""adblock"" category, referencing ASE having a tag for it – I bet no chances for #3 there :)"
767," Matthew Read answered: I don't think it's ever appropriate for a mod to give up.  There are times when you might suspend someone after egregious behavior and a failure to improve, but you still give them another shot when the suspension is over.  AFAIK it's up to the team to make a permanent suspension, and not the mods, and that's probably a good thing.  Matthew Read continued: As for working with problematic users -- it's important to be up front about the site policies and what's expected, and to be polite.  Telling someone they're behaving badly isn't going to work if you're behaving badly yourself.  I always try to point people to the relevant FAQ, Meta post, or blog post that explains the policies and their rationale.  Beyond that there's not much to do besides a suspension -- hopefully a short one gives them the jolt they need.  Al Everett answered: Very willing, and I've been. Most folks are just unaccustomed to the way Stack Overflow works and only need a little gentle prodding. If they stick around they get it. If they don't, they generally get frustrated and leave. Fortunately, my fellow mods can help with persistent troublemakers. Every situation is different, so I can't really say when it's no longer worth the effort.  eldarerathis answered: In the past I've hung around pretty poor questions on SO so that I could try to coax a real question out of someone, then tried to edit stuff an explain the site as best I can. I try to do the same here, and I'm willing to give pretty much anyone a decent shot. If a user is actively resisting any reasonable offers of help or is blatantly offensive, though, then everyone might need to walk away, cool down and try again later (including official suspension, if necessary).  eldarerathis continued: Having said that: I do think some people legitimately have bad attitudes and don't want to play nice. If it becomes clear that a user falls into that category then I'd have no qualms with suspending them, outlining very clearly why they're behaving unacceptably, and letting them try again at a later point.  Bryan Denny answered: I'm very willing to help prod new users in the right direction. But if after a few times they just don't ""get it"" then I'd consult the others on what to do (suspension or otherwise)  Flow answered: I think that the community is our first line of defense again “problematic” users by flagging the posts. I would point the user to our FAQ, especially the “Etiquette” section. If the user doesn’t change his behaviour after the first or second reminder, appropriate actions should be considered. It always depends on the individual case."
1116,"Since the text was copied verbatim from the source, I would have used the ""quote"" feature. Perhaps that's just me, though. Answers in which the only useful information can be found at the end of a link aren't really answers. Links to the author's blog/site are particularly self-serving and ""spammy"". So, if there is good information, those answers should be edited to include that information. Otherwise they should be flagged as ""not an answer"" and/or ""it is spam"" and deleted. Generally speaking, however, information from third-party sources should not be copied verbatim. If memory serves, there is even a Moderator tool to warn users and one of the options is to warn copiers. Yes, this is in order to honor copyright (where it applies) and fairness (where it doesn't). In this particular case, the author of the post is self-identified as the owner of the blog being copied. How does one plagiarize oneself? Part of the purpose of copyright is to keep other people from taking credit for your work. In this case, the person who wrote the original is getting credit for writing it. Copyright is being respected. If the author has a problem with his work being used in this way, as the original author of the post he can very quickly and easily edit it out or delete his question. In this particular case I think the right thing was done. A not-useful answer was turned into a very useful one, and the original author of the information was given credit. Now, when dealing with someone posting verbatim information from a third-party site that they didn't write, well, that's pretty clearly a no-no."
