1567,"I would have to say that this is definitely the right place to be asking about the command line, especially when it is Android specific. Can I trigger a media scan via the command line?"
1342,"No, it's not possible. If you're concerned that a Moderator might act on your flag in error, you can always flag again using the ""Other"" option to explain the error, but I would recommend against that. If you're worried about a ""declined"" flag on your Permanent Record&trade;, don't. The occasional ""declined"" is no big deal. It's when there is a pattern of declined flags when there is a problem."
2379,"The post that you wanted to edit looked like this: This is what I got so far, it might not be the most efficient way to do it.  pm list packages >/storage/emulated/0/Apps.txt
  diff --unchanged-line-format= --old-line-format= --new-line-format='%L' /storage/emulated/0/BaselineApps.txt /storage/emulated/0/Apps.txt | sed 's/^[^:]*://' >/storage/emulated/0/NewApps.txt I suggest, instead of using whitespaces in every line, use &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;/pre&gt; at the beginning of first line and end of last line. E.g.  &lt;pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt; If you're editing the text which falls between a list, simply add one whitespace before &lt;pre&gt; to align the whole preformatted text with the list. E.g. This is what I got so far, it might not be the most efficient way to do it. "
1371,"Sorry for short-circuiting your vote, but this seemed pretty clear-cut to me since most of the translation questions were in fact localization questions.  I've merged and synonymized. I think languages is alright to stay separate since it seems like a proper subset of localization, but I'm open to other options."
822,"I normally save the &lt; kbd > tags for actual hardware buttons (or at least buttons that are normally hardware even if they're sometimes soft) like Power, Menu, Home, Back, etc. For menu options and clicking on items on the screen I'd normally either bold them (or for long options like descriptions on tick boxes ""enclose them in quotes"". So for your example I'd say Settings -> About phone -> Android version Or Settings -> Display -> tick ""Auto-rotate screen"" Or giving a Xoom the ""three-fingered salute"" would be hold down Power + Volume Up at the same time."
9,"If the question in subjective, I generally agree with Ivo Flipse's answer, though I think there are usually good ways to re-phrase the question that are not subjective:  Instead of ""Which dinosaur app..."", you could ask ""What are the differences between these three dinosaur apps?"" or ""Are there any dinosaur apps?"" (Sorry, Dinosaurs were the first random topic that came to mind.  I must be a five year old.)"
651,"I think the conclusions we came to about the official emulator apply here: Questions that are on the fence between development and power use In short, I think we should support end-user questions about it.  I think this would extend to installation troubles as well, just like we do with drivers, rather than pushing them to Super User.  As Al notes, we can wait and see exactly where we feel the line should be. Dev uses of this player should be off-topic, of course."
2235,"The description of Android Enthusiasts on the tour page is that Android Enthusiasts Stack Exchange is a question and answer site for users of the Android operating system. Furthermore, on the related help page it is said that: If your question generally covers... then this is the right place to ask. A malware that operates on Android is surely an issue for end-users of Android. So it is welcome on Android.SE if you ask for precautions or support against."
142,"Treat it like any other answer. Leave a comment about the error to urge the author to correct it and to alert others. There's a common fallacy about the ""accepted answer;"" that its means it was selected as the ""right"" answer or the ""best"" answer. Accepted answer means only that it was the post that best helped the author of the question. Nothing more. It's unfortunate that the answer happened to be incorrect (easily remedied as I described above) but there's nothing to be done about changing the author's personal choice."
497,"This is better explained over at meta.stackoverflow.com. In short, community wikis are discouraged because they encourage ""subjective"" and ""open-ended"" questions.  But sometimes they do make sense.  For example, we have a CW on rooting phones. I believe they removed the option for users to make their own posts into a CW.  Instead, only moderators can make a post CW. 9 times out of 10, a question that ""should be CW"" probably should be closed due to being subjective or not a real question."
