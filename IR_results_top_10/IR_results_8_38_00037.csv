443,"Despite what I just said, on Matthew Read's answer, I'd support merging ""Ubuntu"" and ""Linux"" -- if we aren't going to distinguish every single operating system by version (which sounds to me like crazy talk ... every Mac OS? Every Linux distro and release? Eeek.) there's no reason to break out Ubuntu from Linux."
1615,"The first thing to understand was that this Stack Exchange site graduated from beta to a full site two and a half years ago. The design was set up at that time, and at that time Android v3.x aka Honeycomb was the newest version of the Android OS. You can see the thoughts from Jin, Stack Exchange's designer in this post: Design ideas for Android.se Site. (follow-up design talks: Design mockups for final site theme, New Design Launched &amp; Roboto is the new Droid. The honeycomb-ed background is obviously based on the idea of Android Honeycomb, and in my opinion is nicely understated, just adding a bit of texture to the page. It's also  physically isolated from the input boxes, which are either surrounded by white or black, so I'm not sure what the relevance of being nearly the same colour as the border of the input box has? You could certainly make an argument that Honeycomb is a fairly old version of Android now, but at the same time re-designing the site every time a new version of Android releases is probably a bit more work than Stack Exchange have time for while they're still busy launching new sites every month, all with their own unique designs. The ""green-ish question title and other texts"" points exactly to Android, for the reason that you yourself mention, that green colour is #A4C639. this Meta site is not using Android's bot logo properly If you have a look around the Stack Exchange network, ""meta"" sites always use a desaturated/greyed-out/monochrome version of the main site's theme. The site/Android logo on the main Android.SE site is based on #A4C639, the logo for the meta site is just  a grey version of the same logo. Android's branding guidelines allow for this sort of modification, monochrome-ing a logo is very different from making it pink with yellow polka-dots. that said, do you have any specific suggestions for how these things could be improved?"
1201," Liam W answered:  Both. I believe that I should check to make sure the flags are correct, but also make sure I view new questions and ensure they follow the FAQ and guidelines.  Flow answered:  Plain moderation is purely reactive. But that doesn't prevent anybody from acting on unflagged content. On the other site. before the new review queues I looked at every new question and nowadays I just look what's up on the review queue. It saves some time and with more and more questions per day, looking at every new question becomes nearly impossible. Although I flag/downvote/vc a question here and there.  Suraj Bajaj answered:  Both. You need to proactively dig around to see if anything's wrong. Also respond to the flags by other users."
1206," Liam W answered:  Due to the fact that I haven't been here long, I am going to find this question tricky to answer. I believe that believe that this site is getting more popular, and that the amount of questions is increasing - the same can be said for answers. I am not sure we attract new great users, but we attract new users. I believe that the site is succeeding and improving.  Flow answered:  I think that AN.SX has it's native space in the stackexchange network. The site is very popular according to the traffic stats. And we do have more questions then a year ago. See also my meta post: Statistics about Android Enthusiasts. Not sure if we attract new users, but everyone that struggles with a 1800000 pages thread on XDA is very happy on AN.SX. The site is on a good way, although the diversity of the Android ecosystem makes it hard to answer every question.  Flow continued: We will never be like TEX.SX, although that should be our goal :-D  Suraj Bajaj answered: I think I had mentioned this in my nomination. Here's pasting the same:    My thoughts on Android Enthusiasts:    Being only about a month old member, I have observed a big difference on AE as compared to StackOverflow. A lot of questions go unanswered here and answers come up a bit late. There seems to be a very small number of ""power users,"" and you can see them answer most of the questions. Also the questions and answers on AE are not well written."
1750,"I don't think we should create a tag for each and every app around â€“ that's not the purpose of tags. IMHO for that new Opera browser, the more generic opera-mobile tag should be OK. You can still fine-tune with your question phrasing which variant you're using."
393,"I think for that particular question it's okay. The issue doesn't appear to be device specific, so the steps JonnyP is suggesting should help both people. If Travis had opened a new question, we almost certainly would have closed it as a duplicate of this question. That's not to say that it's okay to hijack someone else's question, but that in this case I don't think it's out-of-bounds."
287,"I don't think we should consolidate.  As Matthew Read pointed out ""rooting techniques vary wildly across devices"" and to add to that, they often change.  What works today may not work tomorrow after an OTA.  Also, there are new devices being released every month.  Creating a community wiki one stop shop for questions like ""When will my device get Froyo?"" is fine because the answer for each device is 2 lines long.  The answer to just one ""How to I root my XXX?"" can be very lengthy on it's own.   Two years from now when I'm looking for info on how to root my Kenmore Washer/Dryer Combo that's running Android 8.1 I don't want to have to sort through the instructions on how to root a G1 or the hundreds of other devices that aren't relevant to me."
1160,"The only flags that need to be responded to quickly are spam, threats, and those where people have included personally identifiable information. All others can wait until they're gotten too. A Diamond should also have a light touch. An awful lot of things that are flagged shouldn't be. A Diamond should be fair, firm, and consistent. A Diamond should have a sense of humor, not take themselves too seriously, and recognize when they're not mentally well-equipped to deal with a situation. A Diamond should be in constant contact with the other Diamonds. Not necessarily to ensure consensus on every decision (although consensus is important) but so that they all know what's going on and to provide support where needed. A Diamond should expect to answer fewer questions and to spend a little time on the site every day, several times a day."
2306,"No. If we took that kind of question, we would end up having to create an index of every device and custom ROM there is. Not only that, we'd have to update it with new versions and to replace dead links. There's no way we can maintain that big a collection of links. For this reason, such questions are always closed as a duplicate of Where can I find stock or custom ROMs for my Android device?, which has a list of places where you can find ROMs for various devices."
1204," Liam W answered:  Tricky question. I believe that the biggest hurdle would be the fact that we are growing at a quick rate, and that the site may not be able to cope (due to lack of users). I would attempt to gather more users, and ensure everyone gets their share of the site.  dymutaos asked:  I'm not sure I understand. If we are 'growing at a quick rate', doesn't that mean we are getting new users?  Liam W responded:  Correct, however not all answer - most ask one question, the vanish forever.  Flow answered:  Something has happened in the last month or so. We had an increase in traffic/questions. But I have the feeling the questions are mostly low quality from drive by users that seek for help. While there is nothing wrong with asking questions, the quality of the question increases the chances for a good answer. I think we need a shorter version of ""How to Ask Questions the Smart Way"", that, for example is displayed to every new user that tries to ask a question here.  Flow continued: For example this section is a good best practise for every SX site."
