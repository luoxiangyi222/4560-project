917,"The best you can really do currently is to create a new room and then invite the user to that room. You can also leave a link to the room as a comment on their post if you want. The automated chat link will also create a public room, so from that regard it's essentially the same (and you can give it whatever title you want). One downside is that the auto-inserted link will import the comments from the post into the chat room when it's created. Creating your own room beforehand will not do this, but if you are pre-emptively setting up a chat with someone then there is likely not going to be a long comment thread to import anyway, I'd imagine. This has also been discussed on Meta Stack Overflow."
2483,"A sincere thanks to the community for reposing your trust and confidence in me to be a moderator. Dan leaving us was known since he communicated his reasoning on Meta. It was an unpleasant surprise but  I fully respect his decisions.  Matthew leaving is a shocker coming out of the blue. At a personal level, I wouldn't have been an active member of this community without him guiding me out of (self created) mess. As they say of Veterans Old soldiers never die, they fade away ; leaving behind their imprints and inspiring us to do better. I wish both  veterans, the best and hope that they do not go off the radar and continue to help the community. "
817,"How many questions of this type are we talking about? How many questions are migrated from here to SO on a daily basis? This would be a fair amount of work, and I'd need to know that it's because there are 10+ questions of this type. Often for low volume stuff, handling it manually is the best option until the volume increases. It's also a little tricky since the intrinsic tag on this site has to exist on the target site, etc. Looking here:  I see 10 questions going to SO for the month of November."

279,"Well, the link is using rel=""nofollow"", so the site's not getting any googlejuice. Just because there's a link to a site does not mean that Stack Exchange or the members of the Android Enthusiasts site endorse it, and I don't think anyone would think that. Also, anyone who doesn't follow safe browsing is not going to be protected by us. Without a link it would be academic to find the site via other means. If the link went somewhere other than what it purported to (goatse anyone?) then it might be a problem. As is I don't think it is a problem. I'm interested in other opinions, however."
2157,"You are right in a lot of ways: And so on. However, the site is not ""going down the tubes"" because this is not new.  We have always dealt with high numbers of these questions, and right now our activity levels are pretty consistent with the past. Making rooting questions off-topic is not really an option.  They can be perfectly good questions and answers (example) and are obviously highly relevant to many Android users.  Many of our most active users are also experts on those types of questions &mdash; it is a core part of the site. I also don't think that separating them out into another area/site will help.  One of the biggest issues we have here is people who completely ignore our existing types of off-topic questions, so such separation would (a) be ignored and (b) not reduce the number of low-quality questions in any way. Instead, I think we should focus on how we can improve them.  We've slowly been forming many ""canonical"" questions for common issues; continuing this is important so that we can quickly mark relevant questions as duplicates and reduce the clutter.  There have also been some suggestions that we ask SE to alter the Ask Question interface to have some sort of warning about our scope and the required level of detail which would be helpful if we could convince them to add it."
1773,"Custom flags (those raised using the ""other"" reason) are intended for things that cannot ordinarily be handled by the community. These flags go directly to the moderators, whereas other flags will go into various review queues that can be acted upon by other users of the site. Someone saying ""thanks"" is simply not something that is generally going to require direct moderator intervention. It is not actively harmful to the site, and there are tools already available to you that are appropriate for the situation: Secondly, as Dan alludes to in his answer, if you do use the ""other"" flag reason, you need to be really, excruciatingly specific in your message. Your flag is basically telling us ""Hey, something is wrong, and I, as a regular user, am unable to handle it with the current tools. I need a moderator!"" Entering your flag description as ""saying thanks"" doesn't provide us with enough information to act on. In the context of this flag, you actually raised two separate flags on the same post, one minute apart from each other. The first is the flag you noted above. The second was a flag on one of the comments on the post. Moderators cannot respond to comment flags, so we had to respond to the post flag instead, which appeared to be connected in purpose to your comment flag based on the timestamp and the content of each flag."
1597,"Scripts can have accounts too. It would be easy for a spammer or other malicious user to sign in and then give control to his script. Having the possibility of a CAPTCHA for signed-in users prevents this attack. The system has a few ways to guess whether particular activity is from a genuine user. Full details aren't available to us end-users, because that would make the system too easy for attackers to defeat. One common way to make the check go wrong is to leave a page open for a long time before submitting the form; for example, you start to answer a question, then get interrupted, go to lunch, come back an hour later, finish answering the question, and then get the CAPTCHA when you try to post your answer. This is because of a token in the page that expires after some time."
856,"Thanks alot Lauren.
I have sent you an email about my contact information. I don't know exactly how you are going to do this? Do you have the Kindle Fire at home, or are you going to order it? Because it can't be ordered from Amazon to Denmark. But it can be sent with the normal air mail directly to me.  But again thanks alot, and looking forward to be an active member on this lovely website :D"
666,"Not sure about smartphones. But there is also tablet, so maybe it makes sense to keep the smartphone tag also. I am in favor of blacklisting mobile-phones and cellphones. Matthew is right: If the phone functionality in question is calling, calls is the tag to go. And for everything else, mobile-phones and cellphones is to broad and inaccurate."
