1770,"Click your avatar in the top bar to visit your profile page. If it says ""more info"" at the top, next to your username, click that. Where it says ""helpful flags"" and then a number, click on the number. On that page, you can see your flagging history, including the status/response of each flag (whether it's still awaiting review, or was judged to be helpful or unhelpful). Alternatively, you can just type in the URL but replacing ""12442"" with your user ID (the number that shows in all URLs about your profile)."
1252,"I am in the GMT time zone and things seem synced up, so I would say it's on the GMT/UTC time. Also, at the bottom of your data box (when you hover over your username on the top bar), it gives the UTC time. However, I think winterba.sh is a number of hours ahead..."
448,"That list is generated at website startup by picking from the top 20 tags at random. If you see things in the list you don't like, that's a strong sign that elements of the site's tagging are broken. If you need us to press the magic ""make it as if this tag never existed"" button, just let me know."
773,"I was a little disappointed when I opened this and discovered that I will not be receiving free ice cream sandwiches all week, but this idea is neat, too. One suggestion: Could we enforce some kind of minimum question score in order to be eligible for any drawings? Entering everybody would allow people to post really bad questions like ""Why is ICS so AWESOME!"" just to get an entry. I'd be inclined to say that only questions with a score greater than zero should be eligible (so at least someone else thought it was a good question). (I also realize this would be a bit different than the Kindle Fire contest, where it appeared that people with zero score posts were entered into the drawing provided that no other answers on the question were upvoted)"
2285,"This close reason is designed to let people know not to ask about general phone issues or generic hardware issues, rather than the much broader ""something not in scope"".  We get quite a lot of these questions, and approximately 0.1% of their askers bother to read the help center.  A slightly larger number read the close reason, so I'd say it's helpful. We also tend to get people who argue based on things like ""well I'm using an Android phone with Sprint, so Sprint's coverage areas are relevant!"" and this shuts them down much more effectively than the help center. Unless you have an idea for a more useful close reason to take the spot of this one, I don't see any reason to take action to remove it."
752,"We have winners! Congratulations to users JT703, Martin, Flow, masterjo and Erowlin, who will each receive a Kindle Fire in the mail. Of dozens of answers submitted for 23 22 eligible questions, 66 answers remain undeleted by moderators today, with 4 marked correct by question askers during the contest period.  19 users were included in the random drawing, with users Martin (5), nonsleepr (2), Eddie (2), and Tom (2) each receiving multiple entries. Thanks for participating and watch out for another contest soon!"
1932,"When in doubt, every Stack Exchange site has a help center page listed as What topics can I ask about here? It lays out the site's scope and acceptable topics. Our site's help page (linked above) describes the purpose of this site: If your question generally covers... then this is the right place to ask. Basically, what problem (with your Android device) are you trying to solve? It goes on to say: Please note the following topics are expressly off-topic here: So no, this site is not for development questions. You should visit Stack Overflow for those questions."
608,"On the one hand I would prefer one site per answer so that we can vote
  on them individually and the good ones can rise to the top. This also
  makes sense since it's impossible to create a single definitive answer
  (some editors will find a particular site useful and others won't). Well, there are a few problems with these questions. Older answers will by default have more votes than newer answers, so for a question that's been open for months, you can't judge anything about the quality of a site/answer by the number of votes (unless they're into the negative, in which case it's a useless answer that misleads visitors who don't understand our voting and should probably be deleted). Once the answers overflow a page, though, you get into a situation
  where new answers never get seen or voted on, since few people go to
  the next page. I think the StackExchange team have tried to combat this effect over time. Unlike us, who've all been here long enough and clicked enough links to change all the defaults, new users coming to those pages will see a semi-random ordering of the answers (I think there's an activity bias to the randomness) so no two visitors should see the same ""first page"" of answers. I'd be tempted to say that if we keep these type of questions on the main site, then rather than treating them as a popularity contest between the answers, we do something more like the other ""community resource"" questions (like the ""when will my phone get updated"", ""how do I root"" type-stuff). So we make (almost) no obvious judgement on the quality of the sites and edit them all into one community wiki answer by category. (obviously the quality bar of each site will now be whether a user thinks they're good enough to nominate, after that all linked sites are treated equally)."
328,I asked the other StackExchange moderators and they say that the mod tools appear for 2k rep on beta sites.  Otherwise I'd say the alert is just being wonky of telling you about the tools.
820,"5 questions isn't much to go by statistically, besides that 2 of the unanswered ones are from shortly before Christmas and the other from yesterday.  Two of them seem fairly obscure as well, so the whole I wouldn't be surprised.  Feel free to edit the older ones (ideally improving them) to bump them to the top of the Active list. Our unanswered question rate is 15% with SO at 19%. I would have expected it to be higher than SO (we do get a lot of obscure questions), but I would agree it does seem a bit high regardless.  Our answer rate is not as high as it was during Beta, either. While I would say the site is ""active"", it's not perfect.  We discussed some of the site's issues before here.  If you have any ideas on how to address any of this, please share them."
