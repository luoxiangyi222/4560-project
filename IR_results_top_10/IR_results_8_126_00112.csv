917,"The best you can really do currently is to create a new room and then invite the user to that room. You can also leave a link to the room as a comment on their post if you want. The automated chat link will also create a public room, so from that regard it's essentially the same (and you can give it whatever title you want). One downside is that the auto-inserted link will import the comments from the post into the chat room when it's created. Creating your own room beforehand will not do this, but if you are pre-emptively setting up a chat with someone then there is likely not going to be a long comment thread to import anyway, I'd imagine. This has also been discussed on Meta Stack Overflow."
2378,"Oh my, I just found the solution:  So the solution is indenting the target text by eight spaces It seems my issue was that I was trying to create preformatted block within a list. For related markdown this article also helps, Markdown help. They also state another way of doing this;
Highlighting target text and pressing ctrl+K"
1947,"That one seems a bit borderline to me. The reason used, ""Questions which are Android-independent...are off-topic..."" is technically correct. I'd expect that Instagram in iOS would act the same way.  But it's also not like you can go to the website and create an account; you can only create an account by installing the app. So I think the question is fine here, even if the answer is probably ""you can't""."
685,"Though I'm also not the kind of guy to ""Like"" or +1 sth, I'd +1 the idea of integrating +1."
2504,"I disagree that answers containing dead links to Play/Whatever Store are useless or should be deleted. There are usually plenty of places where you can find apks, so answer with dead links at least tells that some app exists. I think you should undelete such answers.
Maybe only answers containing links to apps which require some kind of web service which is down forever e.g. clients for dead social network should be deleted. Looks like all apps from your example only changed names and package names and are still available on Google Play: Graffiti for Android, DioPen, PenReader. Anyway old apk versions are also available from first pages of google search (of course user should be careful with these) or e.g. from 4pda.ru. As for AppBrain I don't really like it because of this:

Got it after ~5 pageviews. I'd prefer links to WebArchive instead (or maybe to both of them)."
696,"This is great. Any way we can create a system message or do something else to nudge users to dig thru the old unanswered questions and submit them here? Or how about... can you sort old unanswered questions by view count (I can't) to see what garners interest today? I'd like to maybe nominate 10 or 15 old questions for this initiative &amp; attach a ""bounty"" -- answer a question, throw your name in the hat for a Kindle Fire. Also, I don't see why moderators can't be eligible here."
78,"I just converted all apps and android-app tags to the applications tag. I also created synonyms, please vote :)"
1363,"I respect that you want help others with re-opening your question. However our FAQ states that ""shopping recommendations"" are off-topic on Android Enthusiasts.  In fact all type of recommendations do not fit your Q/A format. A better approach would be something like the already existing question ""Where can I find a comparison of Android devices?"". The answers of this question also provide an answer to your question and the question is within the rules of our FAQ. I personally can only recommend geekaphone: It allows the comparison of different smartphones including the Apple ones."
1448,"Just to close the loop: We're marking this status-declined 'cause it doesn't seem like this is a necessary change. It's also a pretty small tag, so. "
2005,"IMHO we don't need a separate tag for that, as customization (which we already have) covers that perfectly. For ease of transition, we might consider creating personalization as synonym to this – which also had the pro guiding people looking for the right tag, but not as a separate tag. Our tags do not resemble categories in Google Playstore (one could also point at Google asking to create a ""custom-rom"", ""rooting"", or ""adblock"" category, referencing ASE having a tag for it – I bet no chances for #3 there :)"
