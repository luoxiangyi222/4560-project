820,"5 questions isn't much to go by statistically, besides that 2 of the unanswered ones are from shortly before Christmas and the other from yesterday.  Two of them seem fairly obscure as well, so the whole I wouldn't be surprised.  Feel free to edit the older ones (ideally improving them) to bump them to the top of the Active list. Our unanswered question rate is 15% with SO at 19%. I would have expected it to be higher than SO (we do get a lot of obscure questions), but I would agree it does seem a bit high regardless.  Our answer rate is not as high as it was during Beta, either. While I would say the site is ""active"", it's not perfect.  We discussed some of the site's issues before here.  If you have any ideas on how to address any of this, please share them."
860,This if fine by me. Martin covers all the points I was going to say. Pass on over the good questions. :)
14,"I'm going to say that this depends on how specific it is.  At the least, it should be community wiki.  If it isn't specific enough, then it should be closed."
992,"I was the person who rejected those, though from memory you had a queue of about 20 suggested edits on that morning and I'm pretty sure I approved at least half of them. It stuck in my mind because that was an awful lot of edit suggestions from one person, and some of them were very long. I'm sorry if I caused any offence by this, one reason I didn't pick any of the default rejection reasons but instead wrote out a custom one explaining why I'd rejected them was so that you could see why I'd done it. There's no questions tagged with this, it has no reason to exist That was my comment as I rejected those edits. From memory all of your edits were creating new Tag Wiki's and Tag Wiki Excerpts. The very first thing I do when I see a tag wiki edit of any kind in the queue is click the tag, read through the questions currently tagged with that tag, and then come back and see if the wiki edit suggestion seems to match the intent of the questions. When I clicked through the tags you've highlighted above I honestly couldn't see any questions tagged with them. In a couple of cases, because it did look odd to be submitting so many tag wiki's for non-existent tags, as well as clicking through to the tag and going through the tabs (newest, faq, votes, active, unanswered) I also ran searches for the [tag name] on the site, and still couldn't see any questions tagged with those tags. Looking now, there definitely are questions tagged with the tags you point out, and if you re-submitted your edits, I wouldn't reject them again. As to what happened on the day, I genuinely couldn't find any questions using those tags, which means that anything in them will be automatically deleted by the StackExchange engine. However when I look at the edit dates on those questions, a lot of them had the tag in question added before I serached for it, which is odd, and I can't explain what's happened there. I don't know what happened there, and I'm sorry if I caused you any offence, but as far as I could see at the time what I said was true when I looked, and I can't explain why what I was seeing was different from what you saw."
1171,"I have had 2 flags denied now, and I always wondered - is this a bad thing? Two flags is nothing.  As a percentage, you're also doing well. Should I be disheartened if my flag gets denied? Nope.  Just learn from it!  Or if you're convinced, try to explain your case (perhaps using the ""Other"" flag reason). Should I worry about wasting the time of a moderator, because it shouldn't have been flagged? No.  If you see something going wrong we absolutely want you to flag it, a few misses here and there are perfectly fine (especially if you're improving your flagging as you go). An exception is when people flag posts they just don't like, or instead of editing.  That's really annoying and not how flags should be used. I only flag posts for closure because I can't vote to close a post - should I not? Until you can VTC, flagging is the right way to do it. What deem's a 'helpful' flag? Most often, one that results in some kind of action.  If your flag is for the wrong reason but I think another reason still applies, I'll mark it helpful.  If an answer is nigh-unintelligible and you flagged as Not an Answer, but I happen to know what they're talking about and I edit instead, I'll mark the flag helpful. I won't mark the flag helpful in cases where someone flags NAA but it's just a spelling and grammar error-ridden post where the meaning is still clear.  That's the decline reason that says ""Flags should only be used where moderator intervention is required""; we aren't here to do editing on your behalf :) I will also occasionally mark flags helpful in cases where I do absolutely nothing except think hard about it.  When an issue is borderline and I just barely am on the ""nothing needs to be done"" side, I won't fault you for flagging it."
2291,"Looks like someone came to the rescue. As said by @bmdixon in comments,  the suggested edits require two reviewers approval. After going over links of suggested edits, I managed to grab the link of the faulty approved edit and noticed, that at the tine it was not awarded but was waiting for another review.    So if one reviewer approves and the other rejects, a third reviwer is needed to either approve or reject accordingly depending on the post.   Lesson learned: I have to be thorough in reviewing posts and prevent suggested edits that harm post or deviate intended meaning of post from being awarded to users, to ensure that quality is preserved on the site and high levels of reviewing are also maintained. It tends out for now no one is getting banned for approving bad suggested edits this time but it is a wake up call :)"
2089,"I too think it is pretty much off-topic. Example 1: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one should I buy? We simply can't know the expectations and parameters of choice of any person. Example 2: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one is
better? Since utility of a good is not quantifiable, the answers are going to be pretty much subjective and opinion-based. Example 3: I want a phone with following specs: blablabla Can you guys suggest any? There are websites that find phones with the desired specs already."
1773,"Custom flags (those raised using the ""other"" reason) are intended for things that cannot ordinarily be handled by the community. These flags go directly to the moderators, whereas other flags will go into various review queues that can be acted upon by other users of the site. Someone saying ""thanks"" is simply not something that is generally going to require direct moderator intervention. It is not actively harmful to the site, and there are tools already available to you that are appropriate for the situation: Secondly, as Dan alludes to in his answer, if you do use the ""other"" flag reason, you need to be really, excruciatingly specific in your message. Your flag is basically telling us ""Hey, something is wrong, and I, as a regular user, am unable to handle it with the current tools. I need a moderator!"" Entering your flag description as ""saying thanks"" doesn't provide us with enough information to act on. In the context of this flag, you actually raised two separate flags on the same post, one minute apart from each other. The first is the flag you noted above. The second was a flag on one of the comments on the post. Moderators cannot respond to comment flags, so we had to respond to the post flag instead, which appeared to be connected in purpose to your comment flag based on the timestamp and the content of each flag."
633,"I'm getting one and hope to be asking questions here.  Bryan and GAThrawn have explained why. A minor note: Until it's actually released, I expect we won't be accepting questions about it &mdash; the only ones we could answer with certitude pertain to the information Amazon has publicly released.  Just like with Ice Cream Sandwich, we won't speculate or post answers that say ""go look at this thing Eric Schmidt / Jeff Bezos said""; premature questions generally get closed. Just something to keep in mind before you migrate :)"
326,"Better to say ""not at this time"" or ""not that I have found"". Because there very well might not be an app that does what the asker wants. Maybe no one has built it. Maybe it's just not possible with the state of the OS and hardware. At least, as it currently exists. It would be better if askers described what problem they're trying to solve rather than asking for an app. There might be solutions they haven't considered. This shows up one of the problems with shopping recommendations. Personally, I have come around to thinking that ""I need an app that does X, Y, or Z"" should be closed as off-topic, while a better question would be ""How can I do X, Y and Z"". I mean, unless I have actually used an app that does exactly what they're asking for, in order to answer their question I'm just going to the Market and searching on some of their keywords. They can do that. Instead of crafting their own good search, they've finagled me into doing it for them. This site is about helping Android Enthusiasts use their devices, not helping people learn to search."
