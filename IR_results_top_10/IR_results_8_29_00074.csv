823,"I think as long as it's clear you're good to do whatever you want.  Like GAThrawn I would leave the keyboard buttons for actual buttons, though I tend to use bold or nothing for them myself.  I also tend to use inline code for menu items. I suppose in an ideal world we would have a standard, or perhaps site-specific ways to indicate various Android UI elements, but I don't think it's particularly important."
2276,"Yes, it's mainly there so that when someone tries to ask a development question, they can see the tag wiki excerpt: Development questions are off-topic. Do not ask them here. That said, if you browse that tag, you can see that there are some questions there which are about using Android as a development platform, which is OK. If your question is about using Android, it's OK, even if you're a developer or you want to use it for things related to software development. For example, there are some questions in that tag about using Android to write Python code for use on other platforms. They're relevant to our community because the same issues might come up with other text editing tasks. Obviously if the question were along the lines of ""I used my Android phone to write this Python code ... but it doesn't work. What's wrong with my code?"" that question would be off-topic, because then it's not about using Android any more."
794,"I'd say it's fine.  Wanting your services consolidated is a perfectly OK criterion for potential solutions, as is not using a web app. Things to note:"
2379,"The post that you wanted to edit looked like this: This is what I got so far, it might not be the most efficient way to do it.  pm list packages >/storage/emulated/0/Apps.txt
  diff --unchanged-line-format= --old-line-format= --new-line-format='%L' /storage/emulated/0/BaselineApps.txt /storage/emulated/0/Apps.txt | sed 's/^[^:]*://' >/storage/emulated/0/NewApps.txt I suggest, instead of using whitespaces in every line, use &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;/pre&gt; at the beginning of first line and end of last line. E.g.  &lt;pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt; If you're editing the text which falls between a list, simply add one whitespace before &lt;pre&gt; to align the whole preformatted text with the list. E.g. This is what I got so far, it might not be the most efficient way to do it. "
822,"I normally save the &lt; kbd > tags for actual hardware buttons (or at least buttons that are normally hardware even if they're sometimes soft) like Power, Menu, Home, Back, etc. For menu options and clicking on items on the screen I'd normally either bold them (or for long options like descriptions on tick boxes ""enclose them in quotes"". So for your example I'd say Settings -> About phone -> Android version Or Settings -> Display -> tick ""Auto-rotate screen"" Or giving a Xoom the ""three-fingered salute"" would be hold down Power + Volume Up at the same time."
2035,"What is the actual use in grouping phones by chipset?  This site is for end-users, there is going to be virtually nothing relevant in common between two phones from different manufacturers than both happen to include MediaTek chips."
651,"I think the conclusions we came to about the official emulator apply here: Questions that are on the fence between development and power use In short, I think we should support end-user questions about it.  I think this would extend to installation troubles as well, just like we do with drivers, rather than pushing them to Super User.  As Al notes, we can wait and see exactly where we feel the line should be. Dev uses of this player should be off-topic, of course."
1750,"I don't think we should create a tag for each and every app around â€“ that's not the purpose of tags. IMHO for that new Opera browser, the more generic opera-mobile tag should be OK. You can still fine-tune with your question phrasing which variant you're using."
1191," Liam W answered:  TBH I do not think that enough members participate on the meta, from when I have looked. It isn't very active, and only the high rep members seem to use it. Some new members do use it, but not often. I believe that, as this is the case, people should take the meta with a grain of salt - it is OK if a suggestion is up voted by 30 people, but what if other users of the site that don't use meta don't like it?  Liam W continued:  However - they could have had a say, but, by not using the meta, they didn't. So I would probably just use it as it is.  Flow answered:  I am active on meta, so yes, I do fell like a representative percentage of the active meta users. I always considered meta as the place that makes the rules. So the feedback is very welcomed and if it's the opinion of the majority, everyone should follow that.  Suraj Bajaj answered:  I am open to feedback. And believe if opinions on meta make sense to me, it should affect my decisions. After all it's a people's site, you have to consider everyone's opinion and hear everyone's voice."
204,"This emulator question seems to be a unique use case.  He isn't really asking a programming question, but a hardware question (emulated via software) for a user's purpose (new to Android and wanting to try it out before he buys into it).  I don't think this is much different then telling a physical-phone user that they need a bigger SD card. I would even say this ""Tips and Tricks""  question(for the most part) would even belong better here than SO. This however would be a good example of a developer specific question of an emulator question.  More likely than not, emulator questions will be developer questions. I would also consider questions about attaching DDMS (developer logging utility) to a phone (or installing/using aLog) somewhat relevant, because a user may need to do this to get error logs of an app to provide us more info (or to a developer).  There may be other similar ""tools"" that would fall under this. Sometimes high-end power users might actually have to get their hands dirty and actually tweak some things that you might even consider programming related.  Rooting/custom roms falls under this area.  If I think the question is too advanced (beyond what I know), I often point people to xda-developers because they much more experts on rooting and roms than I could ever be.  I'm fully open for these questions being asked here, it's just I don't know if we have the people here that can answer all of these types of questions.  I might consider myself an expert with rooting and using a custom rom on my Motorola Droid or G1, but if someone asked me about [X] or [Y] phone, then I myself would go to xda-forums to see if I can find an answer for them and try to break it down for them here.   (As a side note: providing answers here that xda-forums would provide is much easier to parse/read than a 60 page thread on xda-forums on some new hack a developer came out with for [X] phone because of all the noise and ""discussion.""  I was reading about the NookColor being rooted today and that thread had some interesting gems in it hidden by a LOT of noise)."
