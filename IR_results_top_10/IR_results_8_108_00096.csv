2376,"In most cases, there's no requirement before you can ask or answer. Some questions are protected because they attract a lot of new users to add useless answers like Thank you or Me too, so they got a special handling, that they're made to require 10 reputation for the user before answering. 10 is a considerably low threshold, because 1 upvote on an answer gains you that much. According to statictics, new users tend to generate content of a lower quality, so Stack Exchange decided to add more restrictions, especially rate-limiting to new users. It's also good that you get to learn something before asking. There's already a bunch of rare questions solved and good answers posted, which can solve your problem in most cases without you having to ask again. Reference from Meta Stack Exchange FAQ: What does it mean for a question to be protected?
  Protected questions have the additional restriction that new users are not permitted to answer the question.  Unlike locked questions, they can still be edited, commented on, and voted on.  You can even vote to close them. Why are some questions protected?
  Questions are usually protected because they have attracted either spam answers or ""noisy"" answers such as ""thank you"", ""this worked for me"", or ""I'm also having this problem"" from new users who may mistake the site as a traditional forum. Asking
  - Users with &lt; 125 rep, 40 minutes since their last question anywhere on the network (This applies to the user's IP address, not their account. If the user shares that IP with other users, they can be limited by the other user asking a question anywhere on the network.)"
80,Jeff Atwood nuked the Android tag.  I re-tagged questions that were left as untagged.   I'm not sure if this means users still be able to add new questions with the tag or not.
1105,"Converting Zuul's ""clicker happy"" to ""trigger happy"", I'd like to see the old system available even when the last queue was converted, as I already explained with a post on meta (Is there a way to access the older review tools for processing the edit queue?). While feeling comfortable with the new system when it comes to close-votes, I prefer the old system for some of the others: There I can pick the questions I feel I can do something about, leaving the others completely untouched (so I can even return to them later, which is not possible with the new system). Don't get me wrong: the new system has its advantages. But so has the old... My favorite quote here again: As it stands now, I rarely touch the edit queue unless I'm really bored because I don't want to have to wade through a ton of questions that I can't necessarily help with. This I can easier avoid with the old system. Add a possibility to filter by tag, or to suppress unwanted tags (such as favorite tags and ignored tags in the questions section, or even just honoring those in the review section), so it will even help when we get bigger ;)"
622,"Frankly, I think questions like this should be closed as ""too localized"", but I'm afraid we're going to keep getting them. They're way too localized. Even a question like ""what's new in Android 4.0?"" would be marginal (I'd point them to Wikipedia, I look up what's new in each Google Chrome release on Wikipedia for example). An 2.3.x release on a specific phone model (I'm assuming vendors tweak each release?) is incredibly localized and trivial."
1635,Tags and their structure are very site specific. A user should have some knowledge on how a site does organize its tags in order to create new one. That's one reason why you need 300 rep here and why it doesn't matter what position or how much rep you have on other sites.
1734,"There's no such thing as ""WiFi charging"". Apps that purport to do this are hoaxes. If you're asking about wireless charging that might be a different matter, as there are a few devices that use the technology and it looks to become even more common. (The new Motorola 360 watch is rumored to use wireless charging.) But then, you're asking about a company who might be doing something in this arena and if you can get into their beta program. That's off-topic here. Go ask them. Frankly, I think the question was closed for the wrong reason, but it should be closed. If you have a specific question about an issue with wireless charging on your Android device, by all means add it. But the question you ask is either vague and speculative or not really about Android and is likely to be outdated and useless relatively quickly."
2427,"Done. Please go ahead and post your comment as an answer now. Thank you for asking here instead of taking the easy option by not posting an answer at all. If you're interested, this particular question was protected because of a flood of ""I have the same problem"" answers from new visitors."
2186,"I can't answer for every moderator, and the closest thing I found to an official policy is this question on meta.SE, but I can tell you my perspective. In the case you describe, where a user has written a new answer that isn't the exact same text as an old one but has the same information, typically I'll leave a comment telling the new user that their answer doesn't add anything new, and hinting that it would be better to spend their time on unanswered questions. If there's any possibility the new answer might be useful as a complement to the old one (e.g. it explains things differently, some users might find the new answer clearer, it's updated for a newer version), then I'll leave the answer in place. If it adds nothing at all, I'll usually delete the new answer: not to punish the answerer, but just to keep the site tidy, and to reinforce the message that we're not interested in duplicate content. As a non-moderator, you can add such a comment yourself, but please make sure to keep it encouraging. The new user is probably used to a forum site where you have to repeat replies to show that you agree with them, instead of being able to upvote. They spent their time writing the duplicate answer because they wanted to help, so complaining at them can feel very negative even if it doesn't seem that way to you. Make sure to say that there's no need to write a new answer, rather than that it's ""wrong"". Tell them that answering unanswered questions is more helpful. Welcome them to the site and thank them for contributing. If that all sounds like a lot of work, there's no need for you to do anything. Having the duplicate answer doesn't really harm the site, it just makes it a little harder for the best answer to ""rise to the top"" with upvotes. If you want to add a custom flag to the answer to let the moderators know, feel free, but the outcome will probably depend on which moderator happens to look at the flag. :-) There's another case, which is when a user posts the same exact text as another answer, either by the same or a different user, on the same or a different question. Please always flag these. We'll typically delete the duplicate and tell the poster why, but sometimes the situation is more complex and requires more effort. Sometimes it's a mistake, and the duplicate should have been an edit; sometimes it's plagiarism; sometimes it's an honest attempt to help, but it lets us know that there were duplicate questions that should have been closed. The system does quite a good job of detecting them, but some duplicates slip through. Typically I'll always mark those flags as helpful, even if I end up taking no action."
1016,"This is a new and interesting feature that allows users to spend less effort while doing their part to this community network. The new feature, as any other feature comes with potential bad habits that one may get caught in without noticing. Some that I've noticed across SE are: Clicker happy Experienced users or new users all get involved in such a way that may forget about the real purpose of the review area. Take you time, analyze what you are reviewing: Is there an actual “accept ALL the suggested edits” problem? The usage for competition One interesting part of the new review is that we are able to view who's the top reviewer, what position are we in, and even compare decisions by looking at the review history.  This serves the purpose of providing users a way to improve themselves and refrain from committing mistakes, by learning with others. It is not the Olympic Games, there's no fat payment for the first place, so, don't go voting just because! Vote and review always with the community shirt on. Exaggerated point of view One may get addicted, and as any addiction, there are side effects. If you're tired of seeing what you consider bad answers or bad questions, take a break from review, use the chat to exchange ideas, post a question at META to clarify you point of view. Remember the famous: Could we please be a bit nicer to new users? Don't spend your precious time reviewing just to feel tired and saturated. I'm answering this as to illustrate some of the frequent problems I see on the several SE sites, being discussed on META, and even some that I've personally experienced and/or have been confronted by. Feel free to improve it."
311,"I don't think that's necessary. For one thing it's not a change that would be all that universal. What use would, say, English.SE have for QR codes? Besides, the new web market puts QR codes right on the page. It's only a couple of clicks to get the URL for the image and add it to a message. "
