1803,"I'm terrible at naming things like this, but a lot of the other chat rooms use amusing names to try to mix things up. One that popped into my head was something like: The Candy Shop A chat room for Android users to discuss devices, apps, the latest Android news and gossip, and how many warranties they've voided. Something that plays with the idea of Android releases being named after deserts and such. The description is intended to be a little more friendly but also informational. We probably do need to be conscious of the fact that the room listings only get you 40-50 characters before they truncate (you can see the full description by viewing the room info, though). Therefore, keeping the word ""users"" (or something like that) near the front of the description might be a good idea. Also, by not calling it ""Android"" we might help prevent people with programming questions from getting sucked in."
460,"Maybe something like ""Only add a device or OS tag if your question is truly about your make and model, not just related!"" would be even clearer."
322,"I agree, this isn't the place for it but it would be nice if there was another venue with the same format as SE.  I absolutely despise traditional forums for all the extraneous bs that you have to wade through to find any useful info.  Something like this would really need a voting platform like SE has to let the cream rise to the top."
238,"Sounds like something that would be quite useful. If it were one App per Answer, then each app could be individually voted up/down as well as comments left against it...so each answer in itself is useful..."
778,"It looked like service was actually mostly used to refer to network issues, i.e., problems with ""phone service"".  I replaced it with connectivity in most places, services where applicable.  I think it's probably best to let service die out rather than merge with something else.  If it comes up again we should probably rename it to phone-service or something clearer."
175,"Yes, excellent idea. It's great way to curb the redundant questions and it's a good sticky post that will likely get some link backs from other sites. Also, I agree, the answers should be updated in the question.  It will get very unwieldy having a separate answer for each phone.  Maybe something like this: Title: 
When will my phone get Android 2.3 (Gingerbread)? Body: 
Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) was released on November 11th, 2010.  This community wiki will list all of the known and rumored dates for devices. If you have an update make sure to follow the format that's been established, and the following guidelines:  If you don't have enough rep to edit the wiki, leave your suggestion in a comment or answer and someone will update the list.  HTC G1 Motorola Droid Motorola Droid X  Enter Tablets Here...  Enter other devices here..."
837,"I'd just add to Al's answer that if the tag is inappropriate but not spam or offensive &mdash; e.g., something off-topic like marketing &mdash; it may be better to make a post here on Meta and see what people think.  Marketing might be obviously off-topic, but often it's less clear and there might be several alternative actions to discuss.  See the questions here tagged tags to get a better idea of this."
633,"I'm getting one and hope to be asking questions here.  Bryan and GAThrawn have explained why. A minor note: Until it's actually released, I expect we won't be accepting questions about it &mdash; the only ones we could answer with certitude pertain to the information Amazon has publicly released.  Just like with Ice Cream Sandwich, we won't speculate or post answers that say ""go look at this thing Eric Schmidt / Jeff Bezos said""; premature questions generally get closed. Just something to keep in mind before you migrate :)"
1538,"Should we expect that the users have tried to contact tech support when available? No.  A good chunk of users come to the internet because it's easier than getting tech support. If not, should we recommend they try that before doing anything that might void their warranty? Up to you.  It normally wouldn't be appropriate to provide an answer saying only to contact tech support, but it would be fine as a comment &mdash; assuming that it seems to you like something best handled by tech support."
1795,"Building upon the ""EEE"" (Electronic Engineering Ethos) given by Dan: A place for Android Users from Android.SE, their friends, and their guests to talk about Android … and candies like JellyBeans, Kitkats … Depending on how long the string is allowed to be, we could explicitely add something like … Developers are welcome to listen Or even directly point them to the ""correct room""."
