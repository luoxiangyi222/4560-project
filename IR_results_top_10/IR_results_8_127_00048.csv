1182,"Bad Example: URGENT HELP NEEDED - Galaxy S Problem! Good Example:  Samsung Galaxy S keeps restarting itself randomly. How can I stop this? Every non-native speaker is welcomed to ask questions (and provide answers) on Android Enthusiasts, but we expect a minimum of readability. Errors are human, nevertheless please try your best to write in grammatical, correctly-spelled English. What have you already tried to solve the issue?  Providing those can help avoid answers/comments with suggestions that you have already tried unsuccessfully. Don't try to emphasize a word by writing it in Caps (e.g. ""IMPORTANT""), use bold tags (""important"") or italics (""important"") instead. Don't ask about your attempted solution, instead ask about your actual problem. That is: if you are trying to solve problem X, make sure to ask about X and not about potential solution Y. The daily question limit is high, so please use separate questions for separate issues.  Asking about more than one question in your post will only cause confusion. A picture is worth a thousand words, but try to keep pictures in a reasonable size; huge pictures make it hard to catch the whole idea. It's hard to read a wall of text (example). Make use of Enter once in a while. 1 Although not strictly required, it's often a good idea to phrase the title as complete sentence."
