1519,"Well, we're all public in some ways. Between all of our linked accounts if someone wants to find a personal email address or web site they're going to find it. This is very poor etiquette by the person who emailed you. They shouldn't have done it. However, there is nothing Stack Exchange can do to prevent it, nor should the person be ""punished"" by Stack Exchange because of something they did off the network. In a way, it's understandable. Very often when you're desperate to find a solution you'll grab at anything that looks like a lifeline. Personally, I suggest to simply ignore them. Perhaps create a filter to automatically delete any messages from them in the future. If you're kind, you might respond with something like I'm sorry, but I can't help you. I am happy to volunteer some of my time helping the people who ask questions on Stack Exchange, but I can't possibly offer personalized help. Good luck to you. If you're feeling snarky, you might further respond with something like However, if you would be willing to pay my hourly rate of $150 per hour, minimum 10 hours, I can probably be convinced to help out. Of course, I would need that money up front and if this can't be done remotely you'll need to pay my airfare as well. I wouldn't recommend that last, though. I'd just simply ignore it and twit 'em."
1329,I'd like to hear other opinions too but my stance is that it's ok. Especially since you are an (active) member of the site and sure going to watch the ankidroid tag.  I'd like to make it clear that it's was 100% correct to ask first. Android Enthusiasts should not become a support/discussion forum for the various Android Apps out there if they Apps have a dedicated forum or help site. The question that remains is: Does AE.SX become a second place for Ankidroid support or are you going to close/archive the Google Group?
2187,"A duplicate answer is an answer that does not add any information not alerady in an older answer. Note that the above text is only an example, but you need to provide the link to the original answer, if you want quicker mod action and/or don't want mods to search for a possibly long time to find the original answer because they have to do other things too and you are uselessly delaying them with that. At the bottom of every answer, just above the comment section, there are at least these 3 buttons: ""share"", ""edit"" and ""flag"" (if this isn't there you couldn't flag in the first place.) Then, go to the duplicate answer and do step 5 (or 5.2, if you managed to keep the flag window open all that time). A duplicate answer is a duplicate, no matter when it is posted. It just needs to be posted at least 1 second later than the original one in order to be recognizable as a duplicate."
2170,"The reason I opted for a single expansive answer is because there are really only two core things involved (most of the time): Get USB Debugging enabled. Get the Factory Reset option enabled. Likewise, these generally involve the similar sub-steps &mdash; trick a browser window into opening, trick Settings into opening, maybe create another user account, flag first-time-setup as being completed, etc.  Any user capable of doing these things should be able to piece together something that works on their device &mdash; and if it doesn't, most possible work-arounds would apply to many devices and thus we want to have one central spot to gather them as they are discovered. Because of this, providing a per-device answer would be duplicating a lot of information and hindering that sort of centralized list of strategies.  IMO, splitting these up would be akin to removing the list of many-device rooting tools found at the end of How do I root my Android device? I do think it's valid to leave some specific questions open, like this one: Lg G4 email verification bypass cant do anything.  It could be improved (as per my comment there), but in general something like ""I took the recommended steps X, Y, and Z but the option is still greyed out and trying A and B didn't work"" seems like a great candidate for a separate question. I of course am saying all of the above in good faith, but obviously it must be noted that I am biased because of my answers there.  (Side note, it would be awesome if someone wrote another answer with the exact details of how to erase the partition directly.)"
1930,"Coming late to this one, as I was just thinking about the same (and found this by a ""search-before-ask""): there are actually 3 tags here going very close together. Though at a first glance it looks like they all could be merged-and-synonymed, we should not do so â€“ as all 3 of them have their dedicated purpose: However, these tags should be used in XOR manner: I see no need for any combination (except for making them easier to find, maybe ;)"
2192,"First thing to ensure is that you don't edit the question to alter its meaning.  Invalidating answers like that is discouraged.  (If you hadn't had any answers, it would be fine.) It's up to you whether to accept the answer, but generally you should only do so if you're in a position to verify that it works.  If your problem is different, that might not be possible. If you think the ""real"" problem and solution would be useful to others, then consider posting them as a separate Q&amp;A (answering your own questions is encouraged).  You might want to do a brief search first to see if there is an existing question that matches which you could answer instead."
620,"Case in point:  There are others, however. (This particular question is way too specific, asking about a bug release version on a particular device, but it should illustrate the point.) Anyway, what do we want to do with questions like this? There is no official ""changelog"" we can refer people to, except where there is a major revision. Even so, a change to just the third node in the version number is almost certainly nothing but bug fixes. Frankly, I think questions like this should be closed as ""too localized"", but I'm afraid we're going to keep getting them. Would it be worth it to have canonical questions for each of the major versions? We could add point-releases like this to the major version if we can suss out what was changed."
1303,"It won't work. Like we all do with EULAs, they'll tick the box without reading and keep going.  If there's any fanciness like a timer or making sure they scroll the page, they'll just cheat it and still not read it. There are already lots of pointers to the FAQ and asking guidelines when you post here for the first time.  (Log out and take a look!)  We can do our best to make sure that content is available and helpful, but we can't do anything about the users who refuse to make use of it. See also: Add &quot;I have read the FAQ&quot; check box to the Ask Question page among many others."

917,"The best you can really do currently is to create a new room and then invite the user to that room. You can also leave a link to the room as a comment on their post if you want. The automated chat link will also create a public room, so from that regard it's essentially the same (and you can give it whatever title you want). One downside is that the auto-inserted link will import the comments from the post into the chat room when it's created. Creating your own room beforehand will not do this, but if you are pre-emptively setting up a chat with someone then there is likely not going to be a long comment thread to import anyway, I'd imagine. This has also been discussed on Meta Stack Overflow."
