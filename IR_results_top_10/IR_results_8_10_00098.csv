1066,"I am undecided. This are two different things, although there are  very few  questions. I would let them separated for a while and see how things go."
1365,"Done.  I'm going to double check right now for any ""remote access"" questions that might need to be retagged. Edit: remote-control and remote-access are still a bit messy.  I'm not sure if we should merge them or what.  I don't think there are many questions about using devices as TV remotes so fortunately that isn't complicating things :)"
1311,"What circumstances is a general all-round ""yes you can"" or ""no you can't"" going to be useful? Are you just going to spend days throwing random commands at your tablet in random ways, or is there something specific that you're trying to do? What are you likely to be doing that has a chance of bricking your device? A question like ""Is there a chance rooting my device using the FancyNamed Rooting Method could brick my device?"" is answerable, (and will probably already be answered on the support thread for which ever rooting method you use). Your question as it is at the moment is very broad, has a lot of unknowns, and isn't really answerable with any answer that will stay the test of time."
1258,"Please note the last criterium alone is not enough, as it might turn out to apply more broadly. That's why it should not be closed immediately but first watched for ""access"" (views) and, maybe, comments pointing to that direction."
118,"We should email a some of the big Android Blogs an let them know about Android.SE, invite them to join and share their expertise and encourage them to share it as a resource to their readers.  I was going to just do it but maybe we should discuss a game plan. These are the android sites I frequent:"
886,"Nope.  Once you create a bounty, you lose that rep forever.  I think you used to be able to award it to yourself but it ""didn't count"", and now it's just the more sensible solution of not letting you award it to yourself at all. If someone else is able to help or independently discovers the same fix as you, you may want to consider giving them the bounty.  Otherwise just let it expire &mdash; if it does without you awarding it, half the rep will go to the highest-scoring answer if it's at +2 or more, if there is such an answer.  (If not, no one gets any.)"
1323,"You can edit questions and answers, but they go to a queue, from which moderators and users with enough reputation (over 2000) can accept, discard or improve your edits. From the Edit questions and answers privilege page: Reviewing suggested edits In addition, users with this privilege level also get access to the
  suggested edits queue. The queue has a list of posts which have been
  edited upon by users who don't have edit privileges. This queue can be
  accessed over at the suggested edits tab in the review section. Users
  with this privilege level get access to the Low Quality Posts list
  where they can improved the low quality posts, or suggest they are
  deleted."
448,"That list is generated at website startup by picking from the top 20 tags at random. If you see things in the list you don't like, that's a strong sign that elements of the site's tagging are broken. If you need us to press the magic ""make it as if this tag never existed"" button, just let me know."
1561,"Alright, let's see here what I interpreted, to let others see.  Links enclosed for reference: $ sudo adb reboot download then proceed to flash it. heimdall flash --RECOVERY ./clockworkmod_6.0.3.2_jfltespr.img --no-reboot That is where I understood all three of them are all linked.  Try understand what others would perceive of your line of questioning in relation to Heimdall, all related to flashing recovery which is why I flagged them as duplicates and vote-closed. I even suggested in a helpful comment to try re-edit the questions by consolidating them, in that last linky posted."
443,"Despite what I just said, on Matthew Read's answer, I'd support merging ""Ubuntu"" and ""Linux"" -- if we aren't going to distinguish every single operating system by version (which sounds to me like crazy talk ... every Mac OS? Every Linux distro and release? Eeek.) there's no reason to break out Ubuntu from Linux."
