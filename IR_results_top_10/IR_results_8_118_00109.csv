1973,"After discussing with two to three people and posting this type of question, I found that  No one has any objection on these type of question.  Since it is not possible for all to know about the file standard of android these type of questions will be helpful for people like me. I wanted to know where the saved wifi-passwords are stored and I got an answer from this SE site and therefore I wanted to know about the other files stores in same directory as that of the file which contained the saved wifi passwords.  So this type of questions can be helpful this way. Best Regards, Jasser"
1100,"There's no difference between RAM and memory (in or out the questions) RAM is sometimes called ""memory"" for short which further complicates
  the issue. RAM is a computer chip that assists in speed of the
  computer that is measured in Megabytes (MB) or Gigabyte (GB) depending
  on the size of the chip. When a user chooses to open a file, the
  computer must put that information somewhere to be able to access it.
  It writes the file temporarily to the RAM for easy access. RAM also
  temporarily saves files that are currently being worked on. So I agree with you that they should be merged."
386,Help with Android development and plenty of tutorials
1697,"newbies should always newb out on tutorials, stickies and Google before cluttering forums"
1636,"Android news, app reviews, firmware updates, sharing tips, tricks, tutorials, videos and podcasts, device reviews, info about custom ROMs and hacks."
1127,"Since screen-share and screen-sharing are so similar I didn't synonymize, just kept the latter.  If you start typing the former, the latter should pop up before you finish. share and sharing should now be empty and should be automatically deleted in 24 hours or so. One related case I found was file-sharing.  I'm not sure if this is necessarily a good tag but it's better than the ones we removed, so I left it.  Other questions may need to be retagged to use it if we want to keep it."
2187,"A duplicate answer is an answer that does not add any information not alerady in an older answer. Note that the above text is only an example, but you need to provide the link to the original answer, if you want quicker mod action and/or don't want mods to search for a possibly long time to find the original answer because they have to do other things too and you are uselessly delaying them with that. At the bottom of every answer, just above the comment section, there are at least these 3 buttons: ""share"", ""edit"" and ""flag"" (if this isn't there you couldn't flag in the first place.) Then, go to the duplicate answer and do step 5 (or 5.2, if you managed to keep the flag window open all that time). A duplicate answer is a duplicate, no matter when it is posted. It just needs to be posted at least 1 second later than the original one in order to be recognizable as a duplicate."
1363,"I respect that you want help others with re-opening your question. However our FAQ states that ""shopping recommendations"" are off-topic on Android Enthusiasts.  In fact all type of recommendations do not fit your Q/A format. A better approach would be something like the already existing question ""Where can I find a comparison of Android devices?"". The answers of this question also provide an answer to your question and the question is within the rules of our FAQ. I personally can only recommend geekaphone: It allows the comparison of different smartphones including the Apple ones."
61,"Yes, I find QR links very useful, especially when there are no many barcode scanners around. However, There should be a standard for these ""Here is an App that will help"" posts, just so we aren't A) leaching images, B) not shutting out users who want to see the app without having to go to the market place. Below, I've listed the way I've been linking apps to answers, including how not to leach images (IMPORTANT) because we don't want to get in trouble, now do we? For QR images, I've been using the following method: 1) Find the app on (marketplace e.g. AppBrain) you want to share
 2) Find the QR Code button, and locate the QR code.
 3) Copy the URL of the QR code
 The URL is
 Which is basically  If you use the Image upload tool on the post answer, you can use the image URL to reupload the image to imgur.com
 That way, you get the right QR code, generated from a reliable source, and you don't steal bandwidth. 4) MAKE SURE YOU HREF LINK TO APPBRAIN AT THE SAME TIME
So annoying when you get a QR link, and no web reference to what it is (I'm not sure what other services use, I use AppBrain for a lot of my stuff, but if you know the marketplace URL, just go from step 3 and hardcode the charts.api link yourself) (Freehand circles)"
1730,"I think most savvy users already know better than to run software that's only available as a download from a file-sharing site such as Mediafire, so TBH I wouldn't include such a link at all. If you have to link to an official ROM, then link to the source on the manufacturer's site or equivalent. If you have to link to some other software, link to the distributor's website, or to the relevant XDA Developers page. That has several advantages.  Users can have some confidence about what software they're downloading, and whether it's been tampered with or contains malware On a site like XDA Developers, people discuss the software in question, so visitors can find out more information, and whether the software can be relied on, by looking at other people's comments there. If the distribution method of the software changes, the original page will update their links, so visitors can still get the file without anything on this site having to change. The idea of avoiding link-only answers isn't only to avoid broken links: that reason's quoted most because it's easier to understand. The other reason is that a link-only answer doesn't tell the user what to expect at the other end. Linking to some random file on Mediafire has just the same problem: I don't know whether I'm getting genuine, working software, or a trojan. Linking to an official source or another reputable site lets me know what to expect, making your answer more useful to everyone."
