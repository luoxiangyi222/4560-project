2208,"If you look at your activity on your user profile, there is a tab for ""All Actions"". Within that is a sub-tab which contains all suggested edits you've made, and the list will show them as ""pending"" when they have not yet been reviewed: "
1210,"When you see a post here on meta titled ""2012 Community Moderator Election Results"" you'll be able to read it and know what the results were. That'll usually happen somewhere between 10 minutes and 24 hours after the election ends.  Of course, someone will probably post the results in chat between 10 and 24 seconds after the election ends. But if that's still not quick enough for you, you can download the OpenSTV software and election data and run it yourself (both will be linked to on the election page immediately after the election ends). How long that takes is up to you. "
890,"It's a little verbose, but it can be achieved like so: +title:calendar +title:search However, that's not returning any results. To see the constrained search in action, see this link for this search: +title:calendar +title:facebook"
974,"I would agree as the trend is that external SD-Card is being dropped, Sony, HTC, Samsung... list goes on, maybe we are witnessing the end-of-days for those micro-sd readers embedded on a smartphone due to the production costs and that NAND storage is more cheaper to integrate."
356,"This is very similar to a shopping recommendation and much of the same advice applies.  Beyond that, consider: you have created an ""infinite list of X"" question. Surely there is (probably) an Android equivalent for every single iPhone app? the equivalents, even if valid now, may change over time; apps change over time. The value of this list will be highly limited as it ages. Perhaps if you had specific things you were looking for Android equivalents to on iPhone -- like the built in default applications. But scoping it to ""any app that can ever be, or will ever be"" just doesn't work."
2306,"No. If we took that kind of question, we would end up having to create an index of every device and custom ROM there is. Not only that, we'd have to update it with new versions and to replace dead links. There's no way we can maintain that big a collection of links. For this reason, such questions are always closed as a duplicate of Where can I find stock or custom ROMs for my Android device?, which has a list of places where you can find ROMs for various devices."
2379,"The post that you wanted to edit looked like this: This is what I got so far, it might not be the most efficient way to do it.  pm list packages >/storage/emulated/0/Apps.txt
  diff --unchanged-line-format= --old-line-format= --new-line-format='%L' /storage/emulated/0/BaselineApps.txt /storage/emulated/0/Apps.txt | sed 's/^[^:]*://' >/storage/emulated/0/NewApps.txt I suggest, instead of using whitespaces in every line, use &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;/pre&gt; at the beginning of first line and end of last line. E.g.  &lt;pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt; If you're editing the text which falls between a list, simply add one whitespace before &lt;pre&gt; to align the whole preformatted text with the list. E.g. This is what I got so far, it might not be the most efficient way to do it. "
1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
2096,"I agree that there is little value in questions that are specific to a nightly ROM builds. I think it would be a good idea to have a policy of closing such questions. We want questions (and answers) for the ""long tail"", not questions (and answers) which are only helpful to the Asker in the here-and-now. To that end, a canonical question and answer here on Meta Android (similar, perhaps, to this question on the Uber Meta) would be useful. It should specifically call out the reasons why such questions aren't allowed (already well-delineated in Firelord's question). A ROM should have a stable, public build before it becomes a valid topic here. If there is a ROM where a ""beta"" is as stable as most other ROMs ""final"" release, such an exception could be mentioned here. Another canonical question and answer on the main site could be titled ""I'm having trouble with a daily ROM build. What do I do?"" The answer could explain why such questions are off-topic (with a link to the Meta question I mentioned above), issues need to be forwarded on to the ROM maker, and then list the major ROMs and their bug-reporting mechanisms."
2162,"I'm not an Android programmer and thus cannot evaluate whether it's solving the issue. But if it does, I agree: it might not address our ""main target group"", but that doesn't make it invalid. Specifically: So I see no reason for action â€“ as long as we don't get flooded with such approaches in a way it affects our audience negatively. A hint to the answerer (as placed by beeshyams in this case) I feel justified, though: we shouldn't encourage ""purely programming solutions"" on an end-user site, and those should be exceptions."
