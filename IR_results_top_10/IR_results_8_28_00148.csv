62,"I would say [Android-2.2] or [2.2]. I have no idea what most of the code names refer to, and the phones specs I see online only give the version number, not the code name.  I use a phone with android 1.5 - I know it is 1.5, I don't know what variety of food I would refer to it by. And you could tell me in the comments, but I think most new-ish users would have no idea."
119,"droid.io for ""Android Input/Output""  ""I/O, refers to the communication between an information processing system, and the outside world possibly a human."" This fits in two ways: I know the .io is a little unconventional but I think the name flows nicely and it's short."
872,"Unfortunately, the name ""Android Enthusiasts"" is so close to generic that it's very unlikely we'd be able to stop them from using it. However, our wonderful core developers have told me it's pretty easy to make that hyperlink in the Google results say ""Android Enthusiasts - Stack Exchange"" rather than ""Android - Stack Exchange,"" so that change will be implemented soon. If you're looking to become their friends, maybe a representative from this site could join one of their future hangouts as a special guest? Just a suggestion; interact or don't interact with them as you wish. :) As Matthew Read pointed out, this site is the top Google hit when searching ""Android Enthusiasts"" so there's nothing to worry about right now. They probably just didn't know this site exists and already uses the name they decided to adopt a week ago."
641,"My first thought was that the name Galaxy S actually refers to a series of 9+ devices, but we should probably make the synonym you suggest and create samsung-galaxy-s-series is there's a need for it. I've merged and synonymized the tags."
1710,"Adding the tag to your favourites doesn't actually create the tag, so it doesn't matter whether you have enough reputation or not. It just adds that tag name to a list in your profile. If a tag is subsequently created with that name, the tag will be in your favourites; until then, it has no effect. If there's an error here, it's only that the behaviour is a little confusing. BTW, there's not much point adding a new tag if there's only one question it relates to. Tags with one or zero questions are automatically removed after some time. We also wouldn't normally add a device tag to this particular question, because it doesn't appear to be specific to this model: the same problem could just as easily arise with a different device."
58,"I like ""Android-2.2-Froyo"".   ""Android"" because there may be tags related to specific app versions; both ""2.2"" and ""Froyo"" because not everyone knows the code names (ref at least one question already asked on that topic)."
2504,"I disagree that answers containing dead links to Play/Whatever Store are useless or should be deleted. There are usually plenty of places where you can find apks, so answer with dead links at least tells that some app exists. I think you should undelete such answers.
Maybe only answers containing links to apps which require some kind of web service which is down forever e.g. clients for dead social network should be deleted. Looks like all apps from your example only changed names and package names and are still available on Google Play: Graffiti for Android, DioPen, PenReader. Anyway old apk versions are also available from first pages of google search (of course user should be careful with these) or e.g. from 4pda.ru. As for AppBrain I don't really like it because of this:

Got it after ~5 pageviews. I'd prefer links to WebArchive instead (or maybe to both of them)."
1753,"I don't think there is a button to shrink the image however, you can modify the url to use a smaller image for images hosted at imgur.com. Simply add a m for medium or s for small to the file name like so: change  to  You can see more on the thumbnails available here"
81,"My two cents: The dessert names of the versions is fun and all, but most of your normal users aren't going to have a clue as to what it means. Further, it doesn't appear on the phone, while the version number does. So, at best, our dessert names should only be synonyms. I wonder if the naked [2.2] isn't a bit too esoteric. But, then [android 2.2] and [version 2.2] are redundant if clearer. (The former also has the added benefit that if there were a merger in the future, or Android forked into multiple product paths, no global renames would be required. That's probably not something we should be worrying about, though.) So, I say [&lt;version number&gt;], with [&lt;dessert codename&gt;] and [android-&lt;version number&gt;] as synonyms. Update: The community isn't playing along. android-2.2 x 50 2.2-froyo x 24 froyo x 6 2.2 x 1 1.5-cupcake x 3 android-1.5 x 2 android-2.1 x 34 2.1-eclair x 8 2.5-gingerbread x 1 (which is just plain wrong; everything I've seen indicates Gingerbread will be 3.0, except for this, which implies that Gingerbread might be 2.3) I still stand by my suggestion of raw version numbers (e.g., 2.2) as best, with tags in the style of android-2.2 as second best. Not everyone knows about the dessert names, and if Google stops naming their versions that way it's not going to make any sense. Tags based on the official names is more future-proof."
1704,"Torrent would rather refer to the file (see Torrent file), and thus again would be confusing. Moreover, this is the context this word is most commonly used, IMHO (if one ""downloads a torrent"", he's not downloading a protocol). Checking Wikipedia on ""torrent"" doesn't mention ""torrent"" as protocol, only ""BitTorrent"" (a peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P) communications protocol). Conclusion: bittorrent clearly refers to the protocol, though an application by the same name does exist."
