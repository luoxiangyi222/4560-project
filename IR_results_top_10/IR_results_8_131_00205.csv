666,"Not sure about smartphones. But there is also tablet, so maybe it makes sense to keep the smartphone tag also. I am in favor of blacklisting mobile-phones and cellphones. Matthew is right: If the phone functionality in question is calling, calls is the tag to go. And for everything else, mobile-phones and cellphones is to broad and inaccurate."
917,"The best you can really do currently is to create a new room and then invite the user to that room. You can also leave a link to the room as a comment on their post if you want. The automated chat link will also create a public room, so from that regard it's essentially the same (and you can give it whatever title you want). One downside is that the auto-inserted link will import the comments from the post into the chat room when it's created. Creating your own room beforehand will not do this, but if you are pre-emptively setting up a chat with someone then there is likely not going to be a long comment thread to import anyway, I'd imagine. This has also been discussed on Meta Stack Overflow."
930,"I've kept an eye on this question to see if the community (via voting, commenting, or answering) held any kind of meaningful opinion on this topic, but since the activity here has been relatively flat I'm going to go ahead and add my thoughts. Please understand that this is solely my opinion on the matter. The one concern I have with questions of this nature is where factual data would be coming from. Since the app in question is closed-source any truly helpful answer is going to require either: Because of the nature of proprietary software, any answer that does not involve #1 or #2 is almost certainly going to be speculation or an educated guess. It could very well be an accurate educated guess, but there would be effectively no way for anyone to verify it as such, so the voting largely becomes a matter of ""Yeah, that sounds reasonable"" or ""No, that sounds ridiculous"". On the other hand, I completely understand your motivation and I appreciate the amount of effort and pre-question research you've clearly put into your question. Also, please don't construe my thoughts above as an indication that I think only trivial questions are appropriate for this site - that is certainly not the case at all. Further complicating this is the fact that I do recognize that it is inherently difficult to determine if either points #1 or #2 that I've noted can be met on any given question. So I suppose a related and slightly more general question could be: Is the answerability of question an acceptable metric for moderation, or no? If so, how do we make that determination? If not, at what point to we draw the line on questions that will attract and/or encourage speculative answers? From what I can tell (and correct me if I'm wrong, anyone) that seems to be the crux of the issue here."
1198," Liam W answered:  The fact that I have school 6 hours a day MON - FRI, so I can only come on after that - not that that will impact anything. Maybe also the fact that I tend to take sides occasionally, but I haven't done that for a while.  Flow answered:  Good question, I have to think about it.  Flow continued: Maybe that I am not a native speaker  Suraj Bajaj answered:  Weakness.... Umm.. Not really but being a developer I need to spend some time in dev work. However, I have AE opened in a tab be it at work or at home! But yeah, when it's high time coding I will have to get off AE for some time."
525,"Well, I've installed it on my own site. I've also got the Chrome extension to be able to use it anywhere. I think it could easily go with the Facebook and Twitter links we have already."
863,"This has been already asked already on MSO, although without &quot;official&quot; answer. There's also this answer by Jeff Atwood (admittedly, two years old, and before creation of the diverse family of Area 51 sites) specifically on a question whether English-only policy should be in the FAQ: Do we really need a NO ELEPHANTS sign? I mean, isn't such a thing obvious? Would you go to a forum where everyone was communicating in French and type Hey French Dudes, I got a question but I don't know French so I'm just going to go ahead and ask it in English anyway? Note that this is different from Stack Overflow, where English is a strict requirement. There doesn't seem to be a general consensus or an ex cathedra response, and it seems that it's up to each community to decide for themselves. Although I can appreciate why people would want to be able to ask questions in other languages than English (I'm not a native English speaker either, nor even live in a country where English is an official language), allowing this on Android-SE is going to be a major PITA from pretty much any perspective -- moderation, quality, percentage answered questions, user participation -- for a small to negligible benefit."
1577,"4.3 hasn't seen much action (it hasn't been long), but the questions for 4.1 and 4.2 each have over 20k views. By comparison, the average question got less than 1.8k views in the last year (my calculation assumes no older questions got views, which is obviously wrong). There are definitely problems with these questions but besides being massive drivers of traffic, they're also pretty highly voted.  People want them. I see the direction Google is going, but I don't think we should follow suit until our audience does."
1588,"My opinion is that questions which are purely about gameplay (""How do I beat level 5 in Inexplicably Popular Social Game-of-the-Month?"") should go to Arqade. They simply aren't about Android the OS, even if the title is platform exclusive. Configuring hardware or something to work with a game could be OS dependent - something like ""How can I set up a Bluetooth controller for my Android device?"" as an example - and those seem okay, but gameplay questions should be directed to...well, gamers. We may have gamers here, but it's just not our purpose."
1162,The flavor of Markdown that Stack Exchange uses doesn't support this. I would be against it in any case. Underlines are very commonly understood to indicate links when on web sites. You mess with this very basic and well-understood UI element at your peril. (I can't tell you how many times I've been on some web site and tried to click underlined text and nothing happened.) See also: Why can we format text with bold and italic but not underline? It's been brought up before and unless you can devise a compelling new argument it's not going to be implemented.
1566,"Maybe de-synonym remote-desktop for Android-controlling-non-Android and use remote-access for controlling-Android-from-anything. Also, perhaps remote-control could be repurposed for questions regarding the IR emitters some devices (Samsung GS4 and Galaxy Mega, HTC One, LG Optimus G Pro, etc.) are starting to include."
