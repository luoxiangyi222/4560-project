118,"We should email a some of the big Android Blogs an let them know about Android.SE, invite them to join and share their expertise and encourage them to share it as a resource to their readers.  I was going to just do it but maybe we should discuss a game plan. These are the android sites I frequent:"
1222,"Ok, now I have got over losing (I think), time for this. I just wanted to personally thank everyone that took part and voted, and also every one of the 16 people that chose me as their preferred candidate. If we ever have another election, then maybe I can win this time - maybe more people will vote for me. Congratulations to the two winners, Flow and onik - well done :) If I ever get caught up in my thoughts again, direct me to this post please - and thanks to Izzy for calming me down Yesterday on the chat :) You never know - maybe two moderators will drop out for some reason and I will get instated ;) Just let me say thanks to everyone involved - and congrats to the winners."
666,"Not sure about smartphones. But there is also tablet, so maybe it makes sense to keep the smartphone tag also. I am in favor of blacklisting mobile-phones and cellphones. Matthew is right: If the phone functionality in question is calling, calls is the tag to go. And for everything else, mobile-phones and cellphones is to broad and inaccurate."
737,"It would be more accurate to say ""None that I know of"", because there can perfectly be one, including a private one. Also Stackexchange aims at being a knowledge base, with long term questions and long term valid answers. A ""No"" or ""Not at this time"" is not a long term answer. But actually the question itself is poorly written. It should be ""What application does ..."", having no answer until such an application exists."
1517,"Placing a comment on the question that is going to cause a dup cycle is the right thing to do. Hopefully users working on the review queue will notice the comment and choose the right action (e.g. Leave Open). I also just noticed that the system prevents duplicate cycles (not sure if only direct cycles or also deeper ones). If the cycle has already been established, the you should flag for mod attention and/or cast reopen votes."
1223,"I agree with Al on file-folders and home-screen-folders. I also agree with not needing a separate tag for the mail folders (the email tag should be sufficient here). Number 4 (gallery) are in practice most likely filesystem folders (except when tags would be represented as folders). I don't think this would need a separate tag. But I'm a bit unsure where a possible synonym ""folders"" should point to. If the mentioned brain-washing would not have taken place, I'd happily agree on Al's suggestion here as well; but even being a MS-abstainer I must admit: on hearing the term ""folder"", my first association are directories, followed by email folders, and only after that the homescreen folders -- so I'm unsure about that. One good thing about that synonym would be to save us from a tag with the same name reappearing, though :)"
867,"I'd be careful about merging the 'contacts' and 'people'. Isn't the app in HTC Sense called ""People""?  Also, 2.x and 3.x versions of Android are going to be around (and generating questions) for quite some time yet. I think Matthew Read's suggestion of creating ""contacts-app"" and ""people-app"" is a good one, although I don't think I'm in favor of making one a synonym of the other. They will at least offer a way to distinguish from questions about contacts in general."
2232,"I don't know if there is general SE guidance on this, but I would say yes &mdash; clear cut cases seem like a good place for flags.  This site is not at the point where moderators need to heavily triage flags, as yet.  That said, I also go fully through most queues regularly, so a flag is not strictly necessary."
792,"I am very unlikely to root my device, so I don't really have any skin in this game. That said, I do believe the current canonical question is getting too big and unwieldy. I think ""How do I root device X"" or, even better, ""How do I root Y class of devices"" is a good way to go. I'm concerned, though, about the different ways one can root a device. I would caution against ANY ""how do I root device X with method Y"" questions. I also agree with Flow in that these shouldn't automatically go to Community Wiki. It will take work to put this information together; the people who do should get the reward. We also have a slew of closed questions that can be re-opened and answered. That should make the askers happy. (Although that's not a reason to do this.)"
2089,"I too think it is pretty much off-topic. Example 1: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one should I buy? We simply can't know the expectations and parameters of choice of any person. Example 2: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one is
better? Since utility of a good is not quantifiable, the answers are going to be pretty much subjective and opinion-based. Example 3: I want a phone with following specs: blablabla Can you guys suggest any? There are websites that find phones with the desired specs already."
