2149,"While we're waiting for official response from SE designers team, I decided to create a userstyle for main chat room. It looks like this  You need to install Stylish extension on your browser: Here's the CSS rules Feel free to edit/improve the rules! Some references to Material Design:"
1699,"Done, edited the brightness-tagged question and created synonym."
1601,"Yeah, we can blacklist specific URLs or domains.  But it's unlikely to help here.  Blacklisted terms are fairly easy to work around; if spam is being posted or edited in manually, then it's not too much more difficult for the spammer to use a URL shortener or alternate domain to circumvent the restriction. For those 4 domains, I've found only 6 posts and 2 suggested edits that match any of them (that includes past revisions of posts and rejected edits). Combined with the similarities you've observed, this suggests spammers are already fairly comfortable using ""throw away"" domains to avoid detection. We've taken steps recently to beef up our spam detection systems; the best thing you can do is to flag posts that've been created by spammers, and mark any spam-creating suggested edits appropriately as well. All of this feeds into a database that can block future attempts without the need for further intervention. "
1840,"Shog9♦ has created the motorola-moto-360 tag and set it to existing questions (2, which both are your questions)."
671,"Well, the title pretty much says it all, is it a good idea to create this in advance to reduce a flood of similar questions?"
917,"The best you can really do currently is to create a new room and then invite the user to that room. You can also leave a link to the room as a comment on their post if you want. The automated chat link will also create a public room, so from that regard it's essentially the same (and you can give it whatever title you want). One downside is that the auto-inserted link will import the comments from the post into the chat room when it's created. Creating your own room beforehand will not do this, but if you are pre-emptively setting up a chat with someone then there is likely not going to be a long comment thread to import anyway, I'd imagine. This has also been discussed on Meta Stack Overflow."
515,"We now have a set a guidelines for Stack Exchange Community blogs, so make sure you check out How are blogs created? for details on getting one for this community."
1225,"I think we need to disambiguate the tag, firstly decide what it means, and then rename it to be less ambiguous and put a matching tag wiki on there (currently there's no tag wiki for it which will partially explain the confusion in its use). My proposal would be to rename the tag to input-method-editor and then re-tag all the questions that don't fit anymore, possibly creating something like a hardware-inputs tag for some of them, and adding the (already existing) text-input tag to others like the form entry ones? Sample tag wiki for the IME tag could be something like: An input method editor is a OS or keyboard component or program that
  allows users to enter characters and symbols not found on their
  keyboard. For instance this allows the user of a Latin keyboard to
  input Chinese, Japanese, Korean or Indic characters."
641,"My first thought was that the name Galaxy S actually refers to a series of 9+ devices, but we should probably make the synonym you suggest and create samsung-galaxy-s-series is there's a need for it. I've merged and synonymized the tags."
2005,"IMHO we don't need a separate tag for that, as customization (which we already have) covers that perfectly. For ease of transition, we might consider creating personalization as synonym to this – which also had the pro guiding people looking for the right tag, but not as a separate tag. Our tags do not resemble categories in Google Playstore (one could also point at Google asking to create a ""custom-rom"", ""rooting"", or ""adblock"" category, referencing ASE having a tag for it – I bet no chances for #3 there :)"
