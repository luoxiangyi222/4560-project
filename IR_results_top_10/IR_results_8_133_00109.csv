1930,"Coming late to this one, as I was just thinking about the same (and found this by a ""search-before-ask""): there are actually 3 tags here going very close together. Though at a first glance it looks like they all could be merged-and-synonymed, we should not do so â€“ as all 3 of them have their dedicated purpose: However, these tags should be used in XOR manner: I see no need for any combination (except for making them easier to find, maybe ;)"
903,"I've gone through old posts and closed/deleted them before, but I think you have to be careful with ones you think are Too Localized.  An old unanswered question featuring something you've never heard of will definitely seem localized, but that's actually different from the close reason.  We close things that are Too Localized by nature, rather than by content. For example, a shopping question will always become out of date and will rarely be relevant to others; a perfect candidate for Too Localized.  On the other hand, someone's strange connection issues on a non-name tablet only seem localized until other people show up with the same issue.  Hopefully we can see the difference. I haven't looked at any of your flags yet so I don't know what you've considered Too Localized, but I think this is something we should keep in mind regardless.  Edit: I see a number of them were owned by dead accounts and didn't have enough information to be answerable.  With no one around to provide that information, flagging these is definitely the right thing to do. I do agree with Al's general sentiment that if it doesn't need to be dealt with by a mod, then we can let the voting and so on filter it out.  If you're flagging things that need it, though, by all means do so.  I'd prefer a clogged flag queue over an empty one because at least we have a list of the things that need attention instead of being clueless :)"
14,"I'm going to say that this depends on how specific it is.  At the least, it should be community wiki.  If it isn't specific enough, then it should be closed."
1492,"I don't think app recommendations should be a separate close reason. We turn away app recommendations for two reasons: If the question falls under 1, then we have the new ""opinion-based"" close reason to deal with it. If it falls under 2, then we have the new reason ""too broad"". If the question isn't opinion-based, and doesn't need a list, then why are we closing it? IMO we already have a problem with people flagging or VTCing questions that describe the problem the questioner wants solved and then end with, ""Is there an app that can do that?"" Adding an ""app recommendation"" close reason will, I think, encourage the knee-jerk reaction. I'd rather see flaggers and VTCers (and commenters) think about what's actually wrong with a question before hitting the button."
1241,"It's a problem all over, not just here. Not five minutes ago I voted to close a programming question on Web Applications. And how about all of the ""how do I fix this non-programming Android issue"" questions that have been closed on Stack Overflow? (And believe me, there have been a lot more of them than development questions here.) There are any number of helpful hints to guide potential Askers to the right place. You probably don't remember because you've been around for a while, but there's a dialog that new users need to click through before posting that says basically: I have read what this site is about, I see it again here right in front of me, and this is the right place, so let me ask my question. There's the FAQ, of course. And the ""Ask Question"" page does give guidance, at least until your reputation meets a certain threshold. The problem, and it's not limited to here, is that people don't read on the Web. The only thing that keeps sites on topic is swift, efficient, ruthless moderation when people post off-topic stuff. (Remember Usenet?) That's because people will post off-topic stuff; it can't be stopped. Don't forget, we also have the development tag, which has been left on here as kind of a ""honeypot"" to make it easier to find off-topic questions. (The assumption being, of course, that anyone doing development would see that tag and use it, in spite of the tag wiki excerpt explicitly saying that such questions are off-topic.) Unfortunately, the applications tag (which is terribly misused and abused and is in dire need of cleanup) is almost always one of the sample tags suggested and, since they're developing an application, must be the tag they want, right? So, yes, it's annoying and I wish these people would get a clue. Don't worry about the Moderators' time, though. We don't need to waste it with simple stuff like this. Just continue to vote to close. Downvote them for wasting your time. (Enough downvotes&mdash;six, I believe&mdash;and the question drops off the front page.) If you're feeling kind, point them to the FAQ. But you should probably resign yourself to the fact that no matter how many clues and help and speed bumps we put in front of new users (and there are quite a few), some people are going to post off-topic stuff. All we can hope to do is educate them, hopefully educate people who see their off-topic question and so won't repeat the mistake, and close them down without mercy."
775,Well it partially served as a list of questions that needed to be closed / deleted :P I've removed it from all questions and it should disappear soon.
29,"I think a lot of good points have already been made here but after taking a look at the existing questions, I really think people need to take a good hard look at this: Edit - I missed a few, and more just keep coming and coming... Guys, this is seriously awful.  We are just one day into the beta and out of 109 questions on the site, 22 of them (over 20%) are about which apps are ""good/bad/best"" - yikes! Worse, almost none of them are Community Wiki, so people are actually gaining rep for asking and answering the most mundane and subjective questions imaginable. I think this list very dramatically illustrates the problem with allowing these questions.  There's no end to them.  What's the best compass app?  What's the best flashlight app?  What's the best ukelele simulation app?  Gah! Is this what we're going to be, just a glorified review site?  Is it really that hard to just go to the market and read the reviews?  The Android developers have already built us this beautiful rating and review system that you can access right on your phone.  We don't need this fluff. Please, please, let's start closing these questions.  At the very least close them until we have moderators who can properly wikify them, but even then, I don't want to see people's 1-line recommendations taking up 20% of the site.  This is turning into a land grab with everybody wanting to own one of the big bad 500+ upvoted poll questions.  If we don't nip this in the bud, it's going to bite us hard later on. P.S. I'm not saying every question about an app is bad.  Here are two that are fine: In the first example, somebody is looking for a very specific app and has provided criteria to significantly narrow down the list of candidates.  In the second example, the author is asking for a comparison of two specific apps.  I see no problem with either of these. I just don't want to see two hundred ""Post your favourite [X] app"" polls by the time we hit public beta."
633,"I'm getting one and hope to be asking questions here.  Bryan and GAThrawn have explained why. A minor note: Until it's actually released, I expect we won't be accepting questions about it &mdash; the only ones we could answer with certitude pertain to the information Amazon has publicly released.  Just like with Ice Cream Sandwich, we won't speculate or post answers that say ""go look at this thing Eric Schmidt / Jeff Bezos said""; premature questions generally get closed. Just something to keep in mind before you migrate :)"
2405,"I think it's important to look past the words the questioner happened to use, to see what the intent of the questioner is, and I wish close-voters would put a little more thought into that. This isn't 3-2-1, and you shouldn't lose everything just because you happened to use the magic word ""app"" in your question. Recommendation questions are opinion-based. They ask for lists of answers, and they tend to get spam answers as a result. The answers are less useful than Google Play search results, because they go out of date quickly. This is why we don't like them on the site. Which is the best music player? or Is there a good third-party SMS app? These are simplified examples of bad questions. What kind of answer will they get? A million answers saying ""I like such-and-such app, it's the best"" with no justification. An answer with a one-off copy-paste of Izzy's app lists, which will slowly go out of date or need editors to keep updating it over time. I have a bunch of CSV files in Google Drive and I need to download them when they change and add the results up. Is there an app for that? or I play games on my tablet with my kid ""helping"" sitting on my knee. He often grabs the rim of the tablet and pokes the volume button and makes it really loud. I need the volume buttons turned off when I'm playing a game. Is there an app for that? This doesn't seem like a ""recommendation"" question to me. What kind of answer will it get? There still might be more than one. It might say, ""Use such-and-such app, it can do this out of the box,"" but more likely, it'll say ""You have to install Pushbullet or IFTTT to find out when the file changes, then use Tasker to schedule downloading them and open Excel for Android to load the CSV files,"" or ""You need a custom ROM for this. Lineage can do it."" The difference is, you can replace ""Is there an app?"" with ""How do I solve my problem?"" without really changing the meaning of the question. In the recommendation questions, you can't do that. I think that's the crucial difference. If I find a question like this second pair of examples in the close vote queue, I'll typically make that edit so that people don't close the question, but I don't think the edit should be needed. Just because someone thought an app is the most likely solution to their problem, that doesn't turn a good problem-solving question into a recommendation question. I think we should all apply that test in our head: can I replace ""is there an app?"" with ""is there a solution?"" without changing the meaning of the question."
759," Al Everett answered: I think the current way Stack Overflow handles this is probably the best. Close and lock it, and attach a note that it's kept for posterity but is not a good example of a question for the current topic guidelines.  eldarerathis answered: Close it as off-topic, leave a comment explaining the reasoning for the close. I don't think that off-topic content should exist solely because of perceived usefulness since it sets a poor precedent and gives people questions to point at later down the line if they disagree with the closure of their own.  Matthew Read answered: I'd go to Meta if it's near our scope. Perhaps the scope needs to be expanded if the community is behind it, and we should discuss that. Another option is to talk to the OP and see if they're open to a rewrite that would push it on-topic.  Matthew Read continued: If it's fully off-topic then I'd close as OT with a comment explaining my reasoning. I'm not particularly a fan of locks and I don't think they're needed on Android -- at least not till we get more high-rep users who can enter a voting open/closed battle :P  Bryan Denny answered: I see this on Stackoverflow a lot. Although these questions are popular, they are very distracting to the main purpose of the site.  The question should be closed with an explanation of why  Flow answered: If itâ€™s clearly off-topic as defined by the scope within the FAQ I would close it and ask for discussion about possible corrections or other actions on meta.
