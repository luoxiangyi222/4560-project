356,"This is very similar to a shopping recommendation and much of the same advice applies.  Beyond that, consider: you have created an ""infinite list of X"" question. Surely there is (probably) an Android equivalent for every single iPhone app? the equivalents, even if valid now, may change over time; apps change over time. The value of this list will be highly limited as it ages. Perhaps if you had specific things you were looking for Android equivalents to on iPhone -- like the built in default applications. But scoping it to ""any app that can ever be, or will ever be"" just doesn't work."
533, says they're the same. I'll create synonyms. Update: This is now complete.
1836,"Assuming the instructions for the other device don't apply, downvote. The downvote tooltip says: This answer is not useful Giving instructions for another device that won't work for the device asked about seems pretty ""not useful"" to me. If you're feeling kind, also (or instead) leave a comment saying so. ""These instructions are for the HTC Foo. They won't work for the Samsung Baz, which is what was asked about."""
1333,"Minor edits should come with added value, like rephrasing the sentences or titles so that they are clearer or easier to understand, adding formatting, or editing the tags where applicable. Minor wrong spellings are where we need to think twice on editing. Sometimes, they are  forgivable, sometimes not. But removing ""thanks"" and ""regards"" alone is TOO minor. As for gaming the system, I agree with the others. These points are too small to be an issue. If this was the motivation alone, then it's not worth the effort. Better things can be done with people's time. So, we should appreciate these types of users who are active in keeping the community clean. [You would want this kind off community in Foursquare] Although we have enough moderators and high-rep members who can do these tasks better, these types of users are better off working on more important moderating tasks. At the end, though, we should strive to make things easier to read / understand."
2012,"These questions are not considered to be within our scope: Please note the following topics are expressly off-topic here:
   ...   They were determined to be too problematic because they generally lack lasting value, often attract spam, and often end up being more popularity contests than anything else. Such questions are also sometimes viewed as inherently being ""help me Google this"", and therefore don't mesh well with the goal of building a knowledge repository outside of providing a link or pointer to elsewhere. You could consider asking for recommendations in chat, if you'd like."
671,"Well, the title pretty much says it all, is it a good idea to create this in advance to reduce a flood of similar questions?"
1614,"It's a background, it's not supposed to pop out. I disagree, I think it says ""Android"" very well.  I also don't have a problem reading the green text.  Can you explain how it ""hurt"" your eyes? Android robot The Android robot can be used, reproduced, and modified freely in marketing communications. The color value for print is PMS 376C and the online hex color is #A4C639. ""Modified freely"" seems to be the key phrase there.  I'm also not sure what you think is wrong about it &mdash; is it the wrong color?  As GAThrawn mentions, Meta always use a grayscale theme."
2392,"This is to inform everyone that I've created tags the following tags: nokia-x
nokia-xl
nokia-x-plus
nokia-2
nokia-3
nokia-5
nokia-6 The nokia was supposed to be created so that when a question is on a new model of Nokia smartphones, there is at least one tag present. But with advice from @Izzy, I didn't create it at the end, keeping in mind that some or the other high reputation users or moderator would create the required tag, if they happen to come across the question. @NVZ has added the tag nokia-8."
1605,"Custom ROMs aren't a special topic: they're relevant to Android, so a question on custom ROMs is allowable and encouraged, as long as it fits the other criteria. One of those is that it should be a specific question answerable with facts. Questions that solicit discussion or opinions are discouraged simply because they don't fit well with the question-and-answer format of a Stack Exchange site. The example you gave, ""What would work best with my setup?"" is a perfect example of a question that asks for opinions. What's the best option is usually different for each person. The question would end up with dozens of answers, ""I tried this ROM and I liked such-and-such but this-and-that didn't work for me."" That wouldn't be a beacon of knowledge, it'd be an unreadable mess. The key word in your post is ""discussion"". You say several times that you want to encourage discussion. If you stick around for a while, you'll quickly see that SE sites just don't work well for discussion. It's not a question of ""elitism"", it's just a question of what the SE format can handle and what it can't. If you really want to understand why, you'll find a fuller reasoning of why this is so, based on other sites' experience (but applicable to any SE site) on metaso."
2036,"I wouldn't say ""nothing relevant in common"" as Matthew put it (especially with MTK, which has its specifics). But what I agree with: This site is for end-users, and the majority of end-users probably has no clue whether their device features a mt6582 or rk3066 chip – and if they do, they can specify such in the question's text. A tag is not very useful if ignored by the majority even if it would fit – so I agree with Matthew we don't want/need those on an end-user site (it would look different if we were a techie-centric site, sure)."
