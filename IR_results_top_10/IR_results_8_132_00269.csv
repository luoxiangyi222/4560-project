488,"I really like the design - very clean &amp; elegant. It does occasionally feel a little bit washed out / monochrome however. I'm sure there are specific elements that could be a bit darker or more colourful without changing the overall elegant feel. I think the most constructive thing to do would be to try and identify specific elements like this, as GAThrawn did here. A few more little accents and highlights like this and I'm sure it would all click together beautifully!"
581,"I guess I fall into the ""middle class"" type of user (at the moment). I like to think I'm being generally helpful and contributing, but there's definitely a large, empty gap in the middle rep ranges which I've wondered about for a while. I'm going to go ahead and throw out a couple of things I've personally observed which have a negative impact on the number of available answerable questions. I don't claim any kind of statistical backing to any of this, mind you: That said, I also think that it's somewhat hard to attract real power users to a Q&amp;A site like this. Now I'm not saying we can't or that we should give up because I really enjoy having Android Enthusiasts around, but the nature of the beast is that much of what happens on e.g. XDA is very discussion based. There's a lot of trial and error, people experimenting with things and almost bricking their phones then collaborating on solutions, and developers putting out bleeding-edge stuff for others to test and give feedback on. We just can't cater to that here, and I think it does affect our userbase to some extent. Is it necessarily a bad thing? No, I don't think so. I'm personally glad to be able to come here when I have a question so that I can ask it without it getting lost in a sea of discussion and just get answers. I do think that it's a little bit of a handicap, though. That turned out to be a bit more lengthy than I intended, but that's my $0.02."
1820,"As stated some of your comments are good as answers in their own right. I'm only adding this as it is something I still do. I'm not sure if it's lack of confidence, or some of the HUGE answers to big questions I've read here.  Don't forget answers are fluid things, you can always edit and amend them. People will comment on your answers, and you can always factor that in. You and I need to just start posting answers more often!  Sometimes an answer is just ""No you can't"" like my recent answer here and that's about it. But that is the actual, correct answer!  A good rule I use is try not to recommend the 'nuclear option' as your first advice, it happens a fair bit. My SMS is not sending, factory reset. The brightness is too low, Factory Reset!  This answer I'm writing here is a good example of something that borders on a comment, but in the spirit of things I'm adding it as an answer! "
682,"BlueTooth is wireless, but it isn't wifi. Depending on the use, I could see wireless-network and wireless-networking merged, but Wifi is a specific type of wireless technology. Grammatically, ""wireless-networking"" refers to the concept or practice, and ""wireless-network"" refers to a implemented instance. But I doubt those subtleties are present..."
641,"My first thought was that the name Galaxy S actually refers to a series of 9+ devices, but we should probably make the synonym you suggest and create samsung-galaxy-s-series is there's a need for it. I've merged and synonymized the tags."
155,"Al E.'s great idea just needs a little setting up for those that would miss the reference. Something like: ""Android Questions? These are the Answers you are looking for."" (No comments under 50 rep is a PITA! Sorry for the additional answer)"
1914,"I reopened the question.  I agree with you that it was just a bit unclear but does seem to be about using an old kernel with a new ROM, which is fully within our purview.  If the user wants to know how to create a custom ROM based on that it would be of-topic, but we give the benefit of the doubt. Do note that closure is intended to be a temporary state before either deletion or editing and reopening (which is why it now says ""on hold"").  Quick closure is generally a good thing since it decreases a post's visibility a bit, so it won't gather downvotes while it's being improved and doesn't gather answers focused on the wrong thing.  It is always fully reversible and editing a closed question always nominates it for re-opening."
960,I've removed radio completely and retagged questions when appropriate in the following ways: Since the above 3 tags will appear in the search suggestions when typing the string radio I'm not synonymizing it with any of them. If you see it resurface please feel free to retag as appropriate.
1425,"So most of this already happened at some point (October of last year, it looks like?): The only thing not really covered was the other power-* type tags, but there's another question specifically focusing on that anyway: Tag merge: power, power-management"
1243,"Heck, no. Tags should describe the question. They shouldn't describe the device or the environment. More often than not, the answer(s) to the question has nothing to do with the model of the device or the OS or whether it's rooted or not. Those things are important bits of information to help make the question clearer, but they shouldn't be tags."
