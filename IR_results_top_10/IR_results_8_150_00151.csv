138,"Another thought: I alway link to Appbrain for apps and I'm not going to stop doing that but if you find a solution on another website like Lifehacker, putting a link to the article would be a good idea.  If those sites start getting referrals from android.SE and/or see the back links they may take notice quicker.  "
596,"I would tend to agree. Go ahead and start hitting that ""edit"" link. I have updated the tag-wiki for pc to direct people to more specific tags. It might help."
72,"Pulling this out of comments so it can receive proper votes, if it's the way to go:  [version-codename] 2.1-Eclair 2.2-Froyo This avoids the overly-verbose ""android"" in the tag, and it makes the tag findable with the auto-complete if you start typing either the version number or the codename."
120,"We might also find great benefit in sharing this with Motorola, Samsung, HTC, etc. on-line communities and forums. I think it would be a great opportunity if we started sharing answers, links, etc. at these places! The idea would be to attract users without harming what they have going on already.  What's the best way of doing this? Any other suggestions?"
1549,"If you don't take any time to learn anything about the site you're visiting, it's not going to work for you.  Start here. We're not obligated to help you, and we are a community-led site.  Driveby comments that can be left by anyone are not in our best interest.  You will notice that you don't even need to sign up to post a question or answer, however. Without knowing what question you're referring to or what your comment would be, it's hard to help you further."
2119,"There's a post with the details on the SE Meta site. As far as the badges go, they are: There is a SEDE query that will calculate your current score without having to actually submit a nomination."
1597,"Scripts can have accounts too. It would be easy for a spammer or other malicious user to sign in and then give control to his script. Having the possibility of a CAPTCHA for signed-in users prevents this attack. The system has a few ways to guess whether particular activity is from a genuine user. Full details aren't available to us end-users, because that would make the system too easy for attackers to defeat. One common way to make the check go wrong is to leave a page open for a long time before submitting the form; for example, you start to answer a question, then get interrupted, go to lunch, come back an hour later, finish answering the question, and then get the CAPTCHA when you try to post your answer. This is because of a token in the page that expires after some time."
1534,"You ""asked"" that second question, and offered the solution as an answer. As that solution worked for you, you should accept that answer. If in the future another answer shows up which seems more suitable, you can still accept that (and thus un-accept yours). So I'd go ahead :)"
118,"We should email a some of the big Android Blogs an let them know about Android.SE, invite them to join and share their expertise and encourage them to share it as a resource to their readers.  I was going to just do it but maybe we should discuss a game plan. These are the android sites I frequent:"
863,"This has been already asked already on MSO, although without &quot;official&quot; answer. There's also this answer by Jeff Atwood (admittedly, two years old, and before creation of the diverse family of Area 51 sites) specifically on a question whether English-only policy should be in the FAQ: Do we really need a NO ELEPHANTS sign? I mean, isn't such a thing obvious? Would you go to a forum where everyone was communicating in French and type Hey French Dudes, I got a question but I don't know French so I'm just going to go ahead and ask it in English anyway? Note that this is different from Stack Overflow, where English is a strict requirement. There doesn't seem to be a general consensus or an ex cathedra response, and it seems that it's up to each community to decide for themselves. Although I can appreciate why people would want to be able to ask questions in other languages than English (I'm not a native English speaker either, nor even live in a country where English is an official language), allowing this on Android-SE is going to be a major PITA from pretty much any perspective -- moderation, quality, percentage answered questions, user participation -- for a small to negligible benefit."
