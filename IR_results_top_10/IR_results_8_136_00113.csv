155,"Al E.'s great idea just needs a little setting up for those that would miss the reference. Something like: ""Android Questions? These are the Answers you are looking for."" (No comments under 50 rep is a PITA! Sorry for the additional answer)"
622,"Frankly, I think questions like this should be closed as ""too localized"", but I'm afraid we're going to keep getting them. They're way too localized. Even a question like ""what's new in Android 4.0?"" would be marginal (I'd point them to Wikipedia, I look up what's new in each Google Chrome release on Wikipedia for example). An 2.3.x release on a specific phone model (I'm assuming vendors tweak each release?) is incredibly localized and trivial."
1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
1152,"Yes, why not. There's no reason why we shouldn't opt-in. If Android likes to be cool, why its Enthusiasts can't. Go for it without turning back..."
1588,"My opinion is that questions which are purely about gameplay (""How do I beat level 5 in Inexplicably Popular Social Game-of-the-Month?"") should go to Arqade. They simply aren't about Android the OS, even if the title is platform exclusive. Configuring hardware or something to work with a game could be OS dependent - something like ""How can I set up a Bluetooth controller for my Android device?"" as an example - and those seem okay, but gameplay questions should be directed to...well, gamers. We may have gamers here, but it's just not our purpose."
822,"I normally save the &lt; kbd > tags for actual hardware buttons (or at least buttons that are normally hardware even if they're sometimes soft) like Power, Menu, Home, Back, etc. For menu options and clicking on items on the screen I'd normally either bold them (or for long options like descriptions on tick boxes ""enclose them in quotes"". So for your example I'd say Settings -> About phone -> Android version Or Settings -> Display -> tick ""Auto-rotate screen"" Or giving a Xoom the ""three-fingered salute"" would be hold down Power + Volume Up at the same time."
482,"You might be interested in MinimalOverflow, a userscript that essentially unthemes any SE site. Here's what it looks like applied to this site: Screenshot of MinimalOverflow applied to Android "
1329,I'd like to hear other opinions too but my stance is that it's ok. Especially since you are an (active) member of the site and sure going to watch the ankidroid tag.  I'd like to make it clear that it's was 100% correct to ask first. Android Enthusiasts should not become a support/discussion forum for the various Android Apps out there if they Apps have a dedicated forum or help site. The question that remains is: Does AE.SX become a second place for Ankidroid support or are you going to close/archive the Google Group?
1049,"I don't know, whereas screen and display were really just different ways of saying the same thing,and were proper synonyms. These all seem like specific cases where a specific aspect or behaviour is being asked about. I think people are likely to search for ""screen timeout"" or ""screen brightness"" so these are useful tags. Though as the one question in Screensaver makes clear, that whole idea just doesn't make sense in Android at the moment, so it's debatable whether we need that tag at all. But if things like Android x86 take off and we start seeing Android in more devices like desktop-style machines, or when Android is running devices with expensive screens that are permanently connected to the mains power, like TVs, set top boxes and Ouyas then screensavers could become a real thing for Android in the future."
488,"I really like the design - very clean &amp; elegant. It does occasionally feel a little bit washed out / monochrome however. I'm sure there are specific elements that could be a bit darker or more colourful without changing the overall elegant feel. I think the most constructive thing to do would be to try and identify specific elements like this, as GAThrawn did here. A few more little accents and highlights like this and I'm sure it would all click together beautifully!"
