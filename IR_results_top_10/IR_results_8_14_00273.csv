410,"A very pleasing selection of colours, however looking at the images, isn't there a bit too much wasted screen real estate on either side? Also, I hope this is a fluid layout and renders well on most browsers including those on Android devices. Finally - since we depend on QUESTIONS from users, perhaps the ASK QUESTION could be made more noticeable (either via a change of colouring or font / size)? Great work, overall."
773,"I was a little disappointed when I opened this and discovered that I will not be receiving free ice cream sandwiches all week, but this idea is neat, too. One suggestion: Could we enforce some kind of minimum question score in order to be eligible for any drawings? Entering everybody would allow people to post really bad questions like ""Why is ICS so AWESOME!"" just to get an entry. I'd be inclined to say that only questions with a score greater than zero should be eligible (so at least someone else thought it was a good question). (I also realize this would be a bit different than the Kindle Fire contest, where it appeared that people with zero score posts were entered into the drawing provided that no other answers on the question were upvoted)"
488,"I really like the design - very clean &amp; elegant. It does occasionally feel a little bit washed out / monochrome however. I'm sure there are specific elements that could be a bit darker or more colourful without changing the overall elegant feel. I think the most constructive thing to do would be to try and identify specific elements like this, as GAThrawn did here. A few more little accents and highlights like this and I'm sure it would all click together beautifully!"
736,I like it :-) Maybe you could change  to  under What kind of questions should I not ask here?
1992,"While I can follow Firelord's argumentation, it still seems rather a comment than an answer. As a comment, it would be very acceptable: ""It may be … Could you try …"". Then, with the OP having tried and approved, it would be a good answer: solving the issue as proven. Or it would stay a comment when not proven. My approach thus would have been: Flag NAA, leave a comment, convert to comment on the question. BUT: answerer included ""solve the issue as it did for me"", which in fact is kind of prove (empirical) – so it seems to be a valid answer. I agree however it could use a little re-phrasing to make that clear: In my case, this was an issue with Google Now. I was able to solve it this way: Guess you agree: put that way, you wouldn't complain :) EDIT: Sorry for being a bit unclear. I of course didn't mean to say one should always place a comment first :) So in short:"
1421,"I renamed to device-firmware to make it a little less ambiguous, but didn't do anything with the ROM/custom-rom/etc portions of it at this point. It might be worth a separate discussion of some sort, but I could feasibly see reasons why we would want these separate (e.g. ""device firmware"" could refer to camera firmware or something, not necessarily the phone itself as the ""device"")."
1432,"I don't see how questions as in your examples could be off topic. All of them fit the scope as defined in our FAQ. None of them matches the kind of questions mentioned as explicitly off topic or ""not to be asked"". Question 2 &amp; 3 should be perfectly fine, and I can find no argument defining them off topic. With question 1 one could argue it might be a XY problem, so here it might be a question of phrasing and interpretation: is it the problem you want to solve (and Tasker being your proposed solution) -- or is your question rather to understand how one could use Tasker in this context. The latter, again, should be perfectly fine."
1299,"I think this is a brilliant idea, however not all people tag their questions with development... We could get a bit more complex and make the system learn what tags are mainly associated with closed questions, and then prompt the submitter to check the FAQ, then submit it. And we could have 'banned' tags that cannot be submitted. Would require some hefty development though, but I have faith in the SE devs :)"
525,"Well, I've installed it on my own site. I've also got the Chrome extension to be able to use it anywhere. I think it could easily go with the Facebook and Twitter links we have already."
1419,"As there (currently) is no way to ""categorize"" related tags, it might also be a good idea to sum them up in the ""most generic"" tag of the group to make them easier to find. For example, the security is such a ""quite generic"" tag. So its tag-wiki could contain a list of related tags such as '2-step-verification', 'malware', 'antivirus', 'lost-phone', and the like. Having such a list in a ""single place"" (i.e. the ""declared master-tag"") makes them easier to manage as well: other places (e.g. other tag-wikis) could simply refer to that place (""for other related tags, also see..."") -- and the ""related-list"" would only need to be maintained once."
