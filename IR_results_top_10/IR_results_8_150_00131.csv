209,"If their answer are not complete, you can also create your own complete answer and accept it. You won't get any rep from it nor will your answer get bumped to the top as a normal accepter answer would be, so I really don't think this is cheating"
515,"We now have a set a guidelines for Stack Exchange Community blogs, so make sure you check out How are blogs created? for details on getting one for this community."
878,"I think, a master tag play-store should be created (if it doesn't already exist). market, android-market &amp; google-play tags deserve to be synonym of play-store."
1225,"I think we need to disambiguate the tag, firstly decide what it means, and then rename it to be less ambiguous and put a matching tag wiki on there (currently there's no tag wiki for it which will partially explain the confusion in its use). My proposal would be to rename the tag to input-method-editor and then re-tag all the questions that don't fit anymore, possibly creating something like a hardware-inputs tag for some of them, and adding the (already existing) text-input tag to others like the form entry ones? Sample tag wiki for the IME tag could be something like: An input method editor is a OS or keyboard component or program that
  allows users to enter characters and symbols not found on their
  keyboard. For instance this allows the user of a Latin keyboard to
  input Chinese, Japanese, Korean or Indic characters."
1039,"It's got two Close votes at the moment. Why is it getting upvoted? This is the perpetual meta question on just about all of the Stack Exchange sites. This on-topic Q&amp;A stuff is hard. (For what it's worth, I'd already voted to close both of those.)"
270,"I think we should.  We may not want to expand to Android dev questions and the like, but it would certainly be within the scope of the site to help Android Enthusiasts find resources when they want to get enthusiastic about modding/dev/etc."
1494,"This question is about unauthorized copying of apps, or otherwise violating software copyright. For legal reasons, and to support the Android ecosystem, we don't accept questions that facilitate piracy. We don't get that many piracy questions, but there are occasional ones, so we might as well be ready for them."
61,"Yes, I find QR links very useful, especially when there are no many barcode scanners around. However, There should be a standard for these ""Here is an App that will help"" posts, just so we aren't A) leaching images, B) not shutting out users who want to see the app without having to go to the market place. Below, I've listed the way I've been linking apps to answers, including how not to leach images (IMPORTANT) because we don't want to get in trouble, now do we? For QR images, I've been using the following method: 1) Find the app on (marketplace e.g. AppBrain) you want to share
 2) Find the QR Code button, and locate the QR code.
 3) Copy the URL of the QR code
 The URL is
 Which is basically  If you use the Image upload tool on the post answer, you can use the image URL to reupload the image to imgur.com
 That way, you get the right QR code, generated from a reliable source, and you don't steal bandwidth. 4) MAKE SURE YOU HREF LINK TO APPBRAIN AT THE SAME TIME
So annoying when you get a QR link, and no web reference to what it is (I'm not sure what other services use, I use AppBrain for a lot of my stuff, but if you know the marketplace URL, just go from step 3 and hardcode the charts.api link yourself) (Freehand circles)"
2005,"IMHO we don't need a separate tag for that, as customization (which we already have) covers that perfectly. For ease of transition, we might consider creating personalization as synonym to this – which also had the pro guiding people looking for the right tag, but not as a separate tag. Our tags do not resemble categories in Google Playstore (one could also point at Google asking to create a ""custom-rom"", ""rooting"", or ""adblock"" category, referencing ASE having a tag for it – I bet no chances for #3 there :)"
2375,"Unfortunately you need reputation BEFORE you are allowed to answer a question. Usually it doesn't work like that. But a small number of questions attract a lot of non-answers by new users. Especially with questions that rank high on Google, people will create an account just to post ""yeah, this problem is awful! we need an answer!"" or ""thanks to the other answerers!"" - posts which people are used to from forum sites, but don't fit on our Q&amp;A site at all. Those questions get specially protected. Brand new users can't answer them any more, to avoid inundating the site with non-answers. Although it's a shame this happens, it's a tiny fraction of questions, and it only affects brand new users. You only need one upvote on an answer, or two on a question, or one answer being accepted, before you can answer a protected question, so any useful contribution at all will get you past this block. It's just to reduce the extra work caused by the 95% of people who come here only to create noise, so the rest of us can get on with helping each other."
