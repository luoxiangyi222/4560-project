685,"Though I'm also not the kind of guy to ""Like"" or +1 sth, I'd +1 the idea of integrating +1."
666,"Not sure about smartphones. But there is also tablet, so maybe it makes sense to keep the smartphone tag also. I am in favor of blacklisting mobile-phones and cellphones. Matthew is right: If the phone functionality in question is calling, calls is the tag to go. And for everything else, mobile-phones and cellphones is to broad and inaccurate."
580,"A few projects in the works that may remediate some of these concerns: Improving the algorithm that controls the official Twitter account so that it brings better content and value to followers. Building relationships with mobile &amp; Android blogs for upcoming collaborations (You will soon see an ad for Android Guys in the sidebar + an upcoming program that will ""port"" over our Android release calendar wiki to Android Guys and other outside sites - Please let me know if you know someone else who wants to host this release calendar). Contests! - This relates to both bullets above. Expect a giveaway in the near future executed through Twitter/Facebook in collaboration with an outside Android and/or mobile site. Any other ideas? Further questions? Also, does anyone have a connection at a major Android manufacturer who can help me get a hold of a Thrill, Bionic, Vigor or Galaxy S II?"
867,"I'd be careful about merging the 'contacts' and 'people'. Isn't the app in HTC Sense called ""People""?  Also, 2.x and 3.x versions of Android are going to be around (and generating questions) for quite some time yet. I think Matthew Read's suggestion of creating ""contacts-app"" and ""people-app"" is a good one, although I don't think I'm in favor of making one a synonym of the other. They will at least offer a way to distinguish from questions about contacts in general."
2089,"I too think it is pretty much off-topic. Example 1: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one should I buy? We simply can't know the expectations and parameters of choice of any person. Example 2: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one is
better? Since utility of a good is not quantifiable, the answers are going to be pretty much subjective and opinion-based. Example 3: I want a phone with following specs: blablabla Can you guys suggest any? There are websites that find phones with the desired specs already."
1514,"It looks like the votes tab only shows details for votes to questions and answers still in existance. That is, deleted questions/answers are removed from the votes tab and also change the tally on that page. However, the Stack Exchange database still keeps track of your votes on deleted items and counts that toward the total votes needed for a badge. It also shows this accurate total on the summary profile page. I think that the votes page should show a correct total, perhaps distinguishing between available and deleted votes."
77,There are now several people is one lonely guy with 1000+ reputation. (Didn't we get temporary mods?) This is probably no longer necessary.
1566,"Maybe de-synonym remote-desktop for Android-controlling-non-Android and use remote-access for controlling-Android-from-anything. Also, perhaps remote-control could be repurposed for questions regarding the IR emitters some devices (Samsung GS4 and Galaxy Mega, HTC One, LG Optimus G Pro, etc.) are starting to include."
525,"Well, I've installed it on my own site. I've also got the Chrome extension to be able to use it anywhere. I think it could easily go with the Facebook and Twitter links we have already."
675,"The Android Guys are. The screen shot is obviously from today, as are a good number of the sample questions they suggest. I just wish they'd sorted questions by votes to showcase our ""best of"" stuff."
