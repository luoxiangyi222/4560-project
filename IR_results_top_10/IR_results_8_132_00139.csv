699,"In going back through the unanswered questions, the following twelve seemed to be more likely to garner a response or interest from average user types.  "
475,"Sure. There are plenty of great topics for blog posts that can hopefully go far above and beyond being a mere reference answer for common questions If this gets traction, coordinate with rebecca@stackexchange.com and she can get a provisional blog set up."
72,"Pulling this out of comments so it can receive proper votes, if it's the way to go:  [version-codename] 2.1-Eclair 2.2-Froyo This avoids the overly-verbose ""android"" in the tag, and it makes the tag findable with the auto-complete if you start typing either the version number or the codename."
863,"This has been already asked already on MSO, although without &quot;official&quot; answer. There's also this answer by Jeff Atwood (admittedly, two years old, and before creation of the diverse family of Area 51 sites) specifically on a question whether English-only policy should be in the FAQ: Do we really need a NO ELEPHANTS sign? I mean, isn't such a thing obvious? Would you go to a forum where everyone was communicating in French and type Hey French Dudes, I got a question but I don't know French so I'm just going to go ahead and ask it in English anyway? Note that this is different from Stack Overflow, where English is a strict requirement. There doesn't seem to be a general consensus or an ex cathedra response, and it seems that it's up to each community to decide for themselves. Although I can appreciate why people would want to be able to ask questions in other languages than English (I'm not a native English speaker either, nor even live in a country where English is an official language), allowing this on Android-SE is going to be a major PITA from pretty much any perspective -- moderation, quality, percentage answered questions, user participation -- for a small to negligible benefit."
817,"How many questions of this type are we talking about? How many questions are migrated from here to SO on a daily basis? This would be a fair amount of work, and I'd need to know that it's because there are 10+ questions of this type. Often for low volume stuff, handling it manually is the best option until the volume increases. It's also a little tricky since the intrinsic tag on this site has to exist on the target site, etc. Looking here:  I see 10 questions going to SO for the month of November."
1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
1748,"I'm not totally against this idea, but it would often require the user to research something they may not have been prepared to.  Any barrier to posting has to be carefully considered so quality is balanced with ease of use, since the longer it takes the more likely the user is to go somewhere else.  It's also definitely not up to just the user to define how a tag will be used on the site, and we do have some guidelines and particular formats for types of tags."
830,"Just flag a post that it's on and use the ""other"" option to explain what's going on."
856,"Thanks alot Lauren.
I have sent you an email about my contact information. I don't know exactly how you are going to do this? Do you have the Kindle Fire at home, or are you going to order it? Because it can't be ordered from Amazon to Denmark. But it can be sent with the normal air mail directly to me.  But again thanks alot, and looking forward to be an active member on this lovely website :D"
