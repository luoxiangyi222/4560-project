1365,"Done.  I'm going to double check right now for any ""remote access"" questions that might need to be retagged. Edit: remote-control and remote-access are still a bit messy.  I'm not sure if we should merge them or what.  I don't think there are many questions about using devices as TV remotes so fortunately that isn't complicating things :)"
778,"It looked like service was actually mostly used to refer to network issues, i.e., problems with ""phone service"".  I replaced it with connectivity in most places, services where applicable.  I think it's probably best to let service die out rather than merge with something else.  If it comes up again we should probably rename it to phone-service or something clearer."
886,"Nope.  Once you create a bounty, you lose that rep forever.  I think you used to be able to award it to yourself but it ""didn't count"", and now it's just the more sensible solution of not letting you award it to yourself at all. If someone else is able to help or independently discovers the same fix as you, you may want to consider giving them the bounty.  Otherwise just let it expire &mdash; if it does without you awarding it, half the rep will go to the highest-scoring answer if it's at +2 or more, if there is such an answer.  (If not, no one gets any.)"
1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
1748,"I'm not totally against this idea, but it would often require the user to research something they may not have been prepared to.  Any barrier to posting has to be carefully considered so quality is balanced with ease of use, since the longer it takes the more likely the user is to go somewhere else.  It's also definitely not up to just the user to define how a tag will be used on the site, and we do have some guidelines and particular formats for types of tags."
2001,"Here is the breakdown: You had 1+5+2=8 points until an hour ago.      Then you received a downvote on a post of yours which took two points out of the total, ending up at 6 points.  Now, you pretty much had it all figured out, but you're missing the point stated in help center here: (Emphasis mine) This is simply what happened. You received a single downvote (that -1 between the arrows) on your answer which took away  two points from your account and one point from the user who downvoted it."
847,"I've been lurking on Android-SE for months, on-and-off, mostly to flag a few things every day, to check for something I can answer (mostly non-existent, with the 1+ year old device I currently have). I've seen the promotions previously, and while a good idea generally (who wouldn't mind free stuff?!), I always thought something like ""this probably won't work well enough"". The thing is, such contests award only spurious contributions to the site in the space of a single week or so -- something that the analysis of eldarerathis proves. Moreover, it tends to reward not the loyal users, but rather some random people which were drawn to the site because of the promotion, not because they genuinely like the site.  You can't quite build a stable community this way, me thinking. What would work better is to reward long-lasting, positive contributions to the site, not only in the way of answering and asking questions, but general site governance. It's no big secret that meta participation is low here, chat is deserted, there are too many low-value questions and answers, the tags organization could use some love. Why not reward such activity instead? For example, announce a ""Device/manufacturer cleanup week"", where all questions and answers about a particular handset or a group of related handsets are examined -- the obscure unanswerable ones are closed, some low-quality ones are deleted, answers are cleaned up, device-specific tags are removed where possible, etc. Some general suggestions following this train of thought: Finally, we don't need no stinking phones. No, really. I'd do all this kind of stuff for an Android-SE T-shirt. A shiny new phone doesn't seem a proper reward for spending basically a few minutes of one's time to answer a question. The more disproportionate the reward, the more people are inclined to cheat their way through to claim it. People won't join Android-SE only to get a T-shirt, but they will if the prize is an electronic gadget. That's why there is no significant positive effect from the competitions -- the prizes don't match the commitment. With cheaper prizes, the contest can be run much more frequently, every month even, and the SE financial investment would be pretty much the same. And really finally, allow for converting a prize into a cash donation to a selected Android-related project. No use for a new phone if you already got one recently, it would probably end up on an eBay equivalent somewhere. I'd rather donate the full prize equivalent to a project than go through the hassle of selling unneeded stuff online to get only half of that. "
178,"I have two concerns. One, ""intrusive"" is very subjective. What's intrusive for you may not be a big deal for someone else. Second, and more important, is that I think it's too ambitious and doesn't fit in with this site. The number of tablets is going to grow exponentially and, unless someone is really dedicated, your proposed wiki will never be able to keep up. Once it gets out of date by more than a couple months, it will have lost most of its utility. Plus it has the potential to get really huge. This is the sort of thing that Wikipedia does well. Let them. "
237,"Let's see -- what happens when a site goes public: I might have forgotten something, but I believe that's the major points."
1066,"I am undecided. This are two different things, although there are  very few  questions. I would let them separated for a while and see how things go."
