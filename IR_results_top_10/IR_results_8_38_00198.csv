917,"The best you can really do currently is to create a new room and then invite the user to that room. You can also leave a link to the room as a comment on their post if you want. The automated chat link will also create a public room, so from that regard it's essentially the same (and you can give it whatever title you want). One downside is that the auto-inserted link will import the comments from the post into the chat room when it's created. Creating your own room beforehand will not do this, but if you are pre-emptively setting up a chat with someone then there is likely not going to be a long comment thread to import anyway, I'd imagine. This has also been discussed on Meta Stack Overflow."
833,"In addition to the search filtering that Flow mentions, you can also set up ""favorite"" and ""ignored"" tags from the right sidebar on the main page. Ignored tags will be faded grey on the question lists and favorited ones will be highlighted. "
475,"Sure. There are plenty of great topics for blog posts that can hopefully go far above and beyond being a mere reference answer for common questions If this gets traction, coordinate with rebecca@stackexchange.com and she can get a provisional blog set up."
2544,"Stack Exchange uses WebSocket on some pages (e.g. question lists, chat room) to push updates (e.g. new questions/modified posts, new chat messages) from their server to the client's browser. At the same time, SE also notifies the browser how many updates there are by setting the badge text. Browsers that support badge notification (e.g. Vivaldi, also pinned tabs on Chrome in the past) will show the number of updates on the tab if possible (Vivaldi), or otherwise show a static indicator (pinned tabs on Chrome in the past)."
703,Q: Is it possible to set a HTML signature in the Android Gmail app? (Nov 2011)
1840,"Shog9â™¦ has created the motorola-moto-360 tag and set it to existing questions (2, which both are your questions)."
1588,"My opinion is that questions which are purely about gameplay (""How do I beat level 5 in Inexplicably Popular Social Game-of-the-Month?"") should go to Arqade. They simply aren't about Android the OS, even if the title is platform exclusive. Configuring hardware or something to work with a game could be OS dependent - something like ""How can I set up a Bluetooth controller for my Android device?"" as an example - and those seem okay, but gameplay questions should be directed to...well, gamers. We may have gamers here, but it's just not our purpose."
818,We definitely can't reproduce this. Did you try disabling any Chrome extensions you are using? Did you modify any of the default browser settings?
1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
