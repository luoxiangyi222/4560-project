2379,"The post that you wanted to edit looked like this: This is what I got so far, it might not be the most efficient way to do it.  pm list packages >/storage/emulated/0/Apps.txt
  diff --unchanged-line-format= --old-line-format= --new-line-format='%L' /storage/emulated/0/BaselineApps.txt /storage/emulated/0/Apps.txt | sed 's/^[^:]*://' >/storage/emulated/0/NewApps.txt I suggest, instead of using whitespaces in every line, use &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;/pre&gt; at the beginning of first line and end of last line. E.g.  &lt;pre&gt; &lt;pre&gt; If you're editing the text which falls between a list, simply add one whitespace before &lt;pre&gt; to align the whole preformatted text with the list. E.g. This is what I got so far, it might not be the most efficient way to do it. "
2187,"A duplicate answer is an answer that does not add any information not alerady in an older answer. Note that the above text is only an example, but you need to provide the link to the original answer, if you want quicker mod action and/or don't want mods to search for a possibly long time to find the original answer because they have to do other things too and you are uselessly delaying them with that. At the bottom of every answer, just above the comment section, there are at least these 3 buttons: ""share"", ""edit"" and ""flag"" (if this isn't there you couldn't flag in the first place.) Then, go to the duplicate answer and do step 5 (or 5.2, if you managed to keep the flag window open all that time). A duplicate answer is a duplicate, no matter when it is posted. It just needs to be posted at least 1 second later than the original one in order to be recognizable as a duplicate."
2373,"The founder of Stack Exchange thinks affiliate links should be treated as spam. Unfortunately, Stack Exchange has not clarified their policy further. To me, they should be immediately removed and the user warned. Things could very easily escalate to edit wars (I want to use my affiliate code, not theirs) and spammy behavior (I'm going to add my affiliate code to this answer that I had nothing to do with...it won't change the text...nobody will care). It's a bit of dirty pool, that. By the way, any links to Amazon.com are re-written to include Stack Exchange's affiliate code. That said, of course, I think it's not unreasonable to have a couple of affiliate links in your profile, but only there."
2129,"If it's clear from context that the user suggesting the edit is the same person as the user who posted the post, then yes, please do approve the edit. Typical clues include: While it's theoretically possible that someone would suggest such an edit with incorrect information because they have the same problem or just to troll, it's unlikely. “I have the same problem” cases are clear from wording. Troll cases can happen, but on factual matters, there's nothing to troll. If an edit suggests text that's an opinion piece, then you should reject it. Accepting the edit obviously helps the original user. It also helps the site as a whole it means that the post will get into an acceptable state sooner, so there are fewer moderation actions to take, there are fewer bad posts around, and helping the user drives engagement up. If the suggested edit is from a second account, please leave a comment pointing to the help center, something like You seem to have accidentally created a second account. Please see [the help center]( for how to merge them. Once you merge your accounts, you will be able to edit your posts directly. This is the policy I follow (whether I'm a moderator or not, I don't see why it would make a difference), and until I saw your question in the moderator election it wouldn't have occurred to me that a site would have a policy against it. Having now seen this meta thread, it still isn't clear to me: I'm not a regular here and I don't have enough reputation to review suggested edits, so don't worry, I won't approve edits by a second account of the same user on this site. Nonetheless I'd like to understand why you find my behavior (on other sites) objectionable."
1118,"Just because a question is Closed doesn't mean that it is locked away forever. Being Closed gives the original author (and others) an opportunity to improve the question and, hopefully, get it re-opened. If you believe that the questions are not essentially the same, then please edit your question to make that distinction. It would be a good idea to link to the other question and explain why yours isn't a duplicate. If the community agrees, those with enough Reputation points can vote to re-open. If that process seems slow, you can Flag the question for a Moderator and explain that you've edited the question to make it clear it's not a duplicate. Or, you could raise the issue here (as you've done) but without making the edits to distinguish the questions it might not go very far."
1272,"I usually prefer wi-fi. But seeing that most people prefer WiFi, I will consider this in my next edits.  Off-topic, I don't edits just to change the wi-fi text only. I also consider if the sentences can be rephrased, or added with punctuations for easier readability."
1323,"You can edit questions and answers, but they go to a queue, from which moderators and users with enough reputation (over 2000) can accept, discard or improve your edits. From the Edit questions and answers privilege page: Reviewing suggested edits In addition, users with this privilege level also get access to the
  suggested edits queue. The queue has a list of posts which have been
  edited upon by users who don't have edit privileges. This queue can be
  accessed over at the suggested edits tab in the review section. Users
  with this privilege level get access to the Low Quality Posts list
  where they can improved the low quality posts, or suggest they are
  deleted."
2383,"We don't have review audits on this site. While the second one does look like the random garbage of an autogenerated edit for an audit, it's a real edit someone suggested. We do occasionally get rubbish edits like this, and more often spam edits like the first one you linked. Like flagging posts as spam, rejecting edits as ""spam or vandalism"" feeds the suggester's info (IP address etc.) into the anti-spam system, making it harder for them to come back and keep wasting our time with spam edits."
636,"Personally, I would add a separate answer (as P.T. did in this case).  He provided the up-to-date information and should get credit for it.  So far he's got 40 rep from the answer than he wouldn't have gotten by editing the other answer, and I think he deserves it.  It also serves to alert the post owner that things have changed, which an edit would not.  Finally, the editing page says you should ""clarify meaning without changing it"".  This sort of edit would clearly be changing the meaning. If the post is CW then an edit is appropriate, of course.  For example, Separate answers on our rooting question have been deleted and incorporated into the main post since we want everything to be cohesive. It's certainly inappropriate to downvote the outdated answer (IMO) since the answer was correct and useful at the time it was posted; it's not the answerer's fault that Google changed the game.  I would consider adding a a phrase like ""At the time of posting"" to the outdated answer, though, just to make it clear that the answer was once correct to anyone unfamiliar with the history of the issue.  As Bryan notes you could also mention the newer answer in an edit, but I would be careful with this; you probably don't want to edit another answer to point to your own since it may be viewed unfavorably. (And ""wrong"" answers should never be flagged, outdated or not.)"
1555,"I'm happy about any feedback on this proposed answer. It depends on many factors. For example on whenever you think the question is salvageable by editing. If you are able to edit the question to prevent the close vote, consider doing so. Editing is always the best solution. But if the question is for example unclear, then cast the close vote and motivate questioner to add more information. A down vote is usually not necessary then.  Finally if the question has severe problems that are most likely not solvable, then consider to cast also a downvote with your close vote. Closed, negative score questions will automatically get deleted after 9 days. They don't have to go through the vote to delete process. Background: Before 2013-08-05, certain closed questions received an automatic downvote from community. This process took care to keep AE's delete vote queue short by creating mostly negative score closed questions, but the behavior was changed. "
