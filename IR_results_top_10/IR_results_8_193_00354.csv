1792,"As for the extra 1 you haven't accounted for: every user starts with one reputation point, not zero."
2387,"The bounty amount is deducted from your reputation when the bounty starts, not when it's awarded. For the particular example you mentioned, you can see exactly what happened on the reputation tab of that user's profile. They started with 1 like everyone else, got +100 of association bonus, and then spent it on the bounty to get back to 1 rep. They also got an upvote on the question taking them up to 6. Spending one's association bonus to bounty one's first question on a new site is pretty common but it's quite unfortunate, because you have to get all the way back up to 110 reputation before you can answer protected questions."
90,You start with 1 reputation point. If you link your user account to an account on another Stack Exchange site you get a free 100 point bonus. Thus 101 reputation without asking any questions or giving any answers. Update: Note that the account you link to has to have a minimum amount of reputation itself (200+) or you don't get the bonus. The thinking is that if you're a good contributor on another site that will likely be true on this one as well.  Linked account didn&#39;t get 100 rep points
596,"I would tend to agree. Go ahead and start hitting that ""edit"" link. I have updated the tag-wiki for pc to direct people to more specific tags. It might help."
2165,"One factor nobody has mentioned yet: an answer that says, ""you have to modify the ROM to do it"" could well lead someone (the questioner, or someone else who sees the answer) who has never tried making ROMs to start doing it. Or it could lead to a ROM developer adding that feature to their ROM. Or, in this particular case, someone might see it and realise that a particular ROM already has that feature. I think those all sound like good outcomes. ROM developers don't just spring into existence fully formed: they're just users with problems who try to learn something to solve them. I'm generally quite happy with an answer that leads people into a non-end-user solution, as long as we don't start scaring people off."
1881,"As we already do with rooting questions, we will permit ""one question per permission"", and link to it from What do android application permissions mean? This way we have a double profit: When we've consensus here, I would point that out in the permissions tag wiki. We've already started linking specific answers to permissions in the past, as you can see when taking a look at What do android application permissions mean? So I've just run over all questions tagged permissions and completed that for what we already have."
2355,"I had been an active reviewer of all queues including the First Posts, and I currently top the First Posts review stats at 5436 posts reviewed. In the past I always clear the queue (or use up the daily 20 limit), but starting last month I personally no longer visit the First Posts queue. 3 reasons:"
2434,"I think you're right that there could be a canonical ""how do I identify which app sent a notification?"" question, and I'd encourage you to write one if you can't find an existing one (I don't know of one). I don't think this would quite work with all the ""identify this icon"" questions, because a lot of them are not notifications, and in some cases the questioner reports using the App info feature without much success - for example if it's a system app with an esoteric name. For those questions, I'd encourage questioners to put as much as possible into the question title and body as possible, to make it easier to find the question in searches, and to recognise it as relevant in Related questions lists. To be more specific, taking examples from your screenshot: What notification icon is this fish? That seems very good: ""fish"" is an obvious search term, and if you're starting from a picture of a fish and you see this question title, you might guess it's about your icon. What does this app Icon mean? This is a bad title. It doesn't have enough information to distinguish it from another icon identification question. When you find questions like this, please go ahead and edit them to be more descriptive."
253,"Some good answers here already. I'll contribute by offering generic question titles that don't belong: That's what I have for a start. Related to my answer on the other question, maybe it's simply ""if you can't phrase it as a 'How' question, it probably doesn't belong"". ""When"" and ""Why"", I'd say, are especially problematic."
1597,"Scripts can have accounts too. It would be easy for a spammer or other malicious user to sign in and then give control to his script. Having the possibility of a CAPTCHA for signed-in users prevents this attack. The system has a few ways to guess whether particular activity is from a genuine user. Full details aren't available to us end-users, because that would make the system too easy for attackers to defeat. One common way to make the check go wrong is to leave a page open for a long time before submitting the form; for example, you start to answer a question, then get interrupted, go to lunch, come back an hour later, finish answering the question, and then get the CAPTCHA when you try to post your answer. This is because of a token in the page that expires after some time."
