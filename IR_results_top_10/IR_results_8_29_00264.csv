72,"Pulling this out of comments so it can receive proper votes, if it's the way to go:  [version-codename] 2.1-Eclair 2.2-Froyo This avoids the overly-verbose ""android"" in the tag, and it makes the tag findable with the auto-complete if you start typing either the version number or the codename."
1973,"After discussing with two to three people and posting this type of question, I found that  No one has any objection on these type of question.  Since it is not possible for all to know about the file standard of android these type of questions will be helpful for people like me. I wanted to know where the saved wifi-passwords are stored and I got an answer from this SE site and therefore I wanted to know about the other files stores in same directory as that of the file which contained the saved wifi passwords.  So this type of questions can be helpful this way. Best Regards, Jasser"
699,"In going back through the unanswered questions, the following twelve seemed to be more likely to garner a response or interest from average user types.  "
254,It may also be helpful to enumerate what type of devices are on-topic. What about e-book readers? The B&amp;N Nook is based on Android. (None of the others currently on the market is Android.) Google TV is built on Android. I'm actually surprised we haven't gotten any questions about it already. Is it allowed?
817,"How many questions of this type are we talking about? How many questions are migrated from here to SO on a daily basis? This would be a fair amount of work, and I'd need to know that it's because there are 10+ questions of this type. Often for low volume stuff, handling it manually is the best option until the volume increases. It's also a little tricky since the intrinsic tag on this site has to exist on the target site, etc. Looking here:  I see 10 questions going to SO for the month of November."
419,"Since we're focused on Android, not iDevices, I don't think we need to be as ""strict"" about being very specific about devices or the distinction between hardware and OS. I think the only tags we need are iphone and maybe ios. If the type of device is really that important to the question, then it seems to me that the question is probably off-topic. By the by, some of the questions you're running into were migrated from the defunct gadgets.stackexchange.com. Android and iPhone were both on topic. Not sure if we should bother resurrecting those."
1541,"I think this is out of our domain.  Most of this is really about the physical properties of batteries in general, and not Android or Android device batteries specifically. I also think a lot of the conflicting answers are due to the fact that different batteries (even of the same type, like lithium ion) respond differently to different charge and discharge strategies.  And manufacturers certainly do things differently on a hardware level to interact with the battery.  So I don't think there is an appropriate canonical answer to be had."
2008,"As Izzy's comment has already noted, and as the post notice on your question explains: Questions about writing and publishing Android apps, writing custom ROMs, and other topics that are primarily of concern to developers are off-topic. Consider taking advantage of other resources that may be appropriate for your question. Information about the scope of this site, including the types of questions that are permitted, can be found in our Help Center. For development questions, you may wish to visit Stack Overflow where you can apply the android tag to your question."
2385,"Good find. Merge completed. I don't think this needs a synonym (neither the old on7 nor another galaxy-on7: if you type ""galaxy-on7"" in the tag box, samsung-galaxy-on7 pops up automatically, same if you only type ""on7""."
1363,"I respect that you want help others with re-opening your question. However our FAQ states that ""shopping recommendations"" are off-topic on Android Enthusiasts.  In fact all type of recommendations do not fit your Q/A format. A better approach would be something like the already existing question ""Where can I find a comparison of Android devices?"". The answers of this question also provide an answer to your question and the question is within the rules of our FAQ. I personally can only recommend geekaphone: It allows the comparison of different smartphones including the Apple ones."
