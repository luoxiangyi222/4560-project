better? Since utility of a good is not quantifiable, the answers are going to be pretty much subjective and opinion-based. Example 3: I want a phone with following specs: blablabla Can you guys suggest any? There are websites that find phones with the desired specs already."

I have sent you an email about my contact information. I don't know exactly how you are going to do this? Do you have the Kindle Fire at home, or are you going to order it? Because it can't be ordered from Amazon to Denmark. But it can be sent with the normal air mail directly to me.  But again thanks alot, and looking forward to be an active member on this lovely website :D"

1159,"More Google Juice? Site mentioned in a popular discussion forum as a place to get good answers? A lot of people new to Android? (Considering the apparent great popularity of the Nexus 4/7/10 and the latest Samsung Galaxy, this actually seems most likely.) I don't know that we can ever know. It seems to happen occasionally. Just downvote and/or flag and/or vote to close and/or vote to delete as appropriate and move on."
118,"We should email a some of the big Android Blogs an let them know about Android.SE, invite them to join and share their expertise and encourage them to share it as a resource to their readers.  I was going to just do it but maybe we should discuss a game plan. These are the android sites I frequent:"

This does seem a bit confusing, though, since you could seemingly approve your own edit based on the by-the-letter description of the 1500 rep priv. I don't know if it actually works out that way, though..."
1462,"It looks like the reason is that there actually isn't a mobile optimised version of the tag wiki pages. There are a couple of feature request posts asking for this to be improved/made available, I think the best thing would be to go and post on and vote for those questions:"
1777,"It would be more convenient to search for answers if the tag were split... and it were always used correctly. But most of our visitors have no idea of the difference. Even the existing tag isn't always used appropriately, and I don't think introducing new, finer granularities is going to help that. For this reason, I don't believe that the split you suggest would actually help."
