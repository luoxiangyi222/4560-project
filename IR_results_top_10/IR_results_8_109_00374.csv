833,"In addition to the search filtering that Flow mentions, you can also set up ""favorite"" and ""ignored"" tags from the right sidebar on the main page. Ignored tags will be faded grey on the question lists and favorited ones will be highlighted. "
917,"The best you can really do currently is to create a new room and then invite the user to that room. You can also leave a link to the room as a comment on their post if you want. The automated chat link will also create a public room, so from that regard it's essentially the same (and you can give it whatever title you want). One downside is that the auto-inserted link will import the comments from the post into the chat room when it's created. Creating your own room beforehand will not do this, but if you are pre-emptively setting up a chat with someone then there is likely not going to be a long comment thread to import anyway, I'd imagine. This has also been discussed on Meta Stack Overflow."
2164,"There is a precedent here, a programmatic answer to one of my questions  that guided me to flag this answer as NAA ( flag history reveals this as disputed) Simply put, the point here is usefulness of answer Vs Site Guidelines. Making exceptions based on utility of answer invites setting up a precedent.  Hypothetically, if one knew a better way to code and post  alternative answer highlighting that, what should one do? Or, if the OP/ another visitor who also knows coding seeks a clarification? (Agreed, I am stretching possibilities) IMO, it would be more prudent to adhere to site guidelines and I fully support Firelord's view. He has pointed out successful moderator intervention in past, for deletion of such answers There can and should be a discussion on border line cases but not in cases like this where it is clear cut (= it does not belong here) Edit: Another possible instance where non adherence to site guidelines wouldn't help. There are accepted ( commercially implemented  ) solutions pertaining to charging, which are in the nature of shorting some pins or connecting a resistor across some pins to achieve results These work, are useful but do they belong here ? (on this site, as an answer)"
515,"We now have a set a guidelines for Stack Exchange Community blogs, so make sure you check out How are blogs created? for details on getting one for this community."
1387,"I say no. ""Unknown sources"" is (should be) about the setting. ""Sideloading"" is (should be) about the act of installing an app outside of the context of the Market/Play Store/etc. They are related, sure, but I don't think they're the same."
2544,"Stack Exchange uses WebSocket on some pages (e.g. question lists, chat room) to push updates (e.g. new questions/modified posts, new chat messages) from their server to the client's browser. At the same time, SE also notifies the browser how many updates there are by setting the badge text. Browsers that support badge notification (e.g. Vivaldi, also pinned tabs on Chrome in the past) will show the number of updates on the tab if possible (Vivaldi), or otherwise show a static indicator (pinned tabs on Chrome in the past)."
2076,"Izzy flagged this asking for a canonical answer, and I just declined a couple flags on such posts so I thought I would weigh in again. The length of a post does not determine its quality as an answer. Yes, it's strongly correlated with poor answers.  But some questions only require short answers.  Your concern should be whether it answers the question &mdash; not with whether it could easily fit into the comment space. If a question is answerable by bad one-liners, you should also consider whether it's the question itself that is problematic (but again, it's just a correlation). Beyond that I can't say too much concretely.  It's a subjective and, as noted in the question, experience-based determination."
1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
188,"I can see your frustration and I don't necessarily agree with many of the arguments that are made in support of the current commenting threshold limit.  That being said, I also don't see a compelling reason to change it because the rep level to be able to leave comments is very low at 50 (which you now have from the looks of it).  All this requires is one or all of your answers getting 5 votes.  Or 10 votes on your questions.  Or any number of combinations... the point is that even if it's a problem, it should only be a problem for a short time for any productive member of the community."
1517,"Placing a comment on the question that is going to cause a dup cycle is the right thing to do. Hopefully users working on the review queue will notice the comment and choose the right action (e.g. Leave Open). I also just noticed that the system prevents duplicate cycles (not sure if only direct cycles or also deeper ones). If the cycle has already been established, the you should flag for mod attention and/or cast reopen votes."
