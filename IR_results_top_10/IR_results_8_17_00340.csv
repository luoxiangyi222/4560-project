615,"I think it makes a lot of sense to split these up sensibly, I'd propose something like this Do we really need an app-blocking tag? The one question that I think you're nominating for it, is really a PC question rather than an Android one (and quite an edge case even there) I'd think it would be better off on SuperUser than here, and even then I think ""locking"" is probably closer to what is happening than blocking (seems to be to do with locked handles on mounted drives/files).  *I'd think that call-blocking should be set to a synonym of call-screening (as surely blocking is just a type of screening where you don't allow the call through after screening it). One of the call-screening questions even mentions blocking in the title."
1049,"I don't know, whereas screen and display were really just different ways of saying the same thing,and were proper synonyms. These all seem like specific cases where a specific aspect or behaviour is being asked about. I think people are likely to search for ""screen timeout"" or ""screen brightness"" so these are useful tags. Though as the one question in Screensaver makes clear, that whole idea just doesn't make sense in Android at the moment, so it's debatable whether we need that tag at all. But if things like Android x86 take off and we start seeing Android in more devices like desktop-style machines, or when Android is running devices with expensive screens that are permanently connected to the mains power, like TVs, set top boxes and Ouyas then screensavers could become a real thing for Android in the future."
1051,"It is a question with a definite, non-subjective answer (as long as you just say what has changed and how, and stay away from saying if it's an actual improvement or now). However it's also very localized in time. The answer is only ever going to be useful for someone with your make/model and firmware version. The number of people with that combination is going to shrink to none over time as people pick up and apply the update. I think that this is probably something that would need to be taken on a question by question basis, and probably only for very major updates (eg 2.3 -> 4), or updates that would affect a lot of devices in the same way (eg a TouchWiz or Sense UI update)."
1485,"I agree with GAThrawn, that the rule is simply ""if it's asked from a developer's perspective then the question is off-topic on Android Enthusiasts.""  I like to add that it is not always easy to say which questions are clearly developer questions and which are power end-users ones. I'd like to see more tolerance for the later ones. But the mentioned question from OP is simply off-topic according the above rule. On a side note: Maybe it would be a good idea to fill the gap between Android Enthusiasts (end-users) and stackoverflow (developers). ATM the gap is filled by external sites like XDA. But I really like the idea of a SX site for non Android API programming and Android internals questions, something like the proposed Android Internals."
2405,"I think it's important to look past the words the questioner happened to use, to see what the intent of the questioner is, and I wish close-voters would put a little more thought into that. This isn't 3-2-1, and you shouldn't lose everything just because you happened to use the magic word ""app"" in your question. Recommendation questions are opinion-based. They ask for lists of answers, and they tend to get spam answers as a result. The answers are less useful than Google Play search results, because they go out of date quickly. This is why we don't like them on the site. Which is the best music player? or Is there a good third-party SMS app? These are simplified examples of bad questions. What kind of answer will they get? A million answers saying ""I like such-and-such app, it's the best"" with no justification. An answer with a one-off copy-paste of Izzy's app lists, which will slowly go out of date or need editors to keep updating it over time. I have a bunch of CSV files in Google Drive and I need to download them when they change and add the results up. Is there an app for that? or I play games on my tablet with my kid ""helping"" sitting on my knee. He often grabs the rim of the tablet and pokes the volume button and makes it really loud. I need the volume buttons turned off when I'm playing a game. Is there an app for that? This doesn't seem like a ""recommendation"" question to me. What kind of answer will it get? There still might be more than one. It might say, ""Use such-and-such app, it can do this out of the box,"" but more likely, it'll say ""You have to install Pushbullet or IFTTT to find out when the file changes, then use Tasker to schedule downloading them and open Excel for Android to load the CSV files,"" or ""You need a custom ROM for this. Lineage can do it."" The difference is, you can replace ""Is there an app?"" with ""How do I solve my problem?"" without really changing the meaning of the question. In the recommendation questions, you can't do that. I think that's the crucial difference. If I find a question like this second pair of examples in the close vote queue, I'll typically make that edit so that people don't close the question, but I don't think the edit should be needed. Just because someone thought an app is the most likely solution to their problem, that doesn't turn a good problem-solving question into a recommendation question. I think we should all apply that test in our head: can I replace ""is there an app?"" with ""is there a solution?"" without changing the meaning of the question."
1148,"I've re-opened it.  I don't think one person verifying that they can see the buttons is enough to say that no one else will be unable to see them, like you.  I can't think of any reason why this would be happening to you and only you, so I think it passes the ""potentially useful to others"" metric. The nature of the question obviously changed due to the comments, however &mdash; it's some combination of your account/location/environment/app version/etc. and the particular apps rather than something about the particular apps that affects everyone.  I've edited it as such, please make sure to do such editing yourself when possible.  Secondly the question would benefit from extra information, such as:"
822,"I normally save the &lt; kbd > tags for actual hardware buttons (or at least buttons that are normally hardware even if they're sometimes soft) like Power, Menu, Home, Back, etc. For menu options and clicking on items on the screen I'd normally either bold them (or for long options like descriptions on tick boxes ""enclose them in quotes"". So for your example I'd say Settings -> About phone -> Android version Or Settings -> Display -> tick ""Auto-rotate screen"" Or giving a Xoom the ""three-fingered salute"" would be hold down Power + Volume Up at the same time."
533, says they're the same. I'll create synonyms. Update: This is now complete.
1907,"status-completed The icon has been updated. I like the design as well. The ""flair"" icon needs to be updated as it is using the older version: "
1273,"Alternative spellings are good, because they provide different search paths.  Editing a post just to change ""wifi"" to ""Wi-Fi"" would seem to me to be the very definition of a ""too minor"" edit. Like a lot of tech terms, there is no universally accepted spelling. (Not to say that there aren't style guides that try to standardize on one or the other, but we don't adhere to one of those.) Now, if you'd spelled it as ""wife"" (as I've done more than once) then it should definitely be fixed. Otherwise you've got a question better suited for marriage.stackoverflow.com. Similar to how we don't change posts from British spellings, I think for the most part this should just be left alone."
