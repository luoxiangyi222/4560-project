90,You start with 1 reputation point. If you link your user account to an account on another Stack Exchange site you get a free 100 point bonus. Thus 101 reputation without asking any questions or giving any answers. Update: Note that the account you link to has to have a minimum amount of reputation itself (200+) or you don't get the bonus. The thinking is that if you're a good contributor on another site that will likely be true on this one as well.  Linked account didn&#39;t get 100 rep points
935,"Well, the whole point of the shortcuts is to make typing [name of the site]( faster and less wasteful of precious comment characters. If you just want a link to the meta site, pasting in  does just fine.  Gotta admit, I kinda like ""our Meta site"" as a less formal version of the text though."
1436,"This is something of a fringe case. Without divulging too much in the way of ""personal"" information, I will simply say that the website(s) from the flagged posts were being inappropriately promoted here by multiple parties. I felt this warranted a bit of investigative work, and wanted to (for at least the time being) preserve the account's details. The reason I chose an arbitrarily large suspension length was because anything else felt...disingenuous, to a point. I had no intention of reinstating the account at any point in the future, but as there is no ""permanent"" suspension - by definition, basically - I simply typed in a large number to make clear the purpose of the suspension to whomever would be receiving the suspension notice. I certainly did not expect the user to wait with bated breath for the opportunity to return in a decade with the intention of being a well-behaved community member - as you've said, that's quite unrealistic (for a number of reasons). At this point, you'll find the account has been destroyed for now, though onik's answer is correct in that a destroyed account can simply be re-created. Whether or not this will prove to be problematic remains to be seen, and we'll cross that bridge if we have to."
1792,"As for the extra 1 you haven't accounted for: every user starts with one reputation point, not zero."
2459,"Judging by the number of low-quality deleted answers on this question, it's just a question that has been high in Google search results for a long time. Such questions are most likely to attract spam answers because spammers want to attack the pages that get most views, or that show up in searches for their spam keywords. You'll notice some similarities between the ""helpful"" content of the spam answers - most likely, both were copied from the same source of generic advice. The third post you quote is the same kind of spam comment you can see on any blog nowadays."
134,"Well, you can tether via USB or bluetooth.  But with separate [wifi] (or [usb] or [bluetooth]) and [tether] tags, that should get the point across"
294,"Well, on meta.stackoverflow they use faq-proposed. Seems reasonable to me. Especially since some people have already started using it: "

801,"Suggested ""X week!"" topic: wi-fi tethering: because, well, a lot of people want to do it, in spite of the roadblocks their carrier places in their way"
370,"We don't want questions phrased as: ""What is an app that does A, B, and C?"" We want questions phrased as ""How do I do X, Y, and Z?"" The answer to the latter may very well be an app, but then again maybe not. When you ask for an app, you've already got a solution in mind. Answers to that are generally only going to help you. We're more interested in questions that may help many people."
