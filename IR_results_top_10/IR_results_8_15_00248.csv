1992,"While I can follow Firelord's argumentation, it still seems rather a comment than an answer. As a comment, it would be very acceptable: ""It may be … Could you try …"". Then, with the OP having tried and approved, it would be a good answer: solving the issue as proven. Or it would stay a comment when not proven. My approach thus would have been: Flag NAA, leave a comment, convert to comment on the question. BUT: answerer included ""solve the issue as it did for me"", which in fact is kind of prove (empirical) – so it seems to be a valid answer. I agree however it could use a little re-phrasing to make that clear: In my case, this was an issue with Google Now. I was able to solve it this way: Guess you agree: put that way, you wouldn't complain :) EDIT: Sorry for being a bit unclear. I of course didn't mean to say one should always place a comment first :) So in short:"
1165,Comments use the same mark down as answers. You can use this syntax for links: [link text](url)
1820,"As stated some of your comments are good as answers in their own right. I'm only adding this as it is something I still do. I'm not sure if it's lack of confidence, or some of the HUGE answers to big questions I've read here.  Don't forget answers are fluid things, you can always edit and amend them. People will comment on your answers, and you can always factor that in. You and I need to just start posting answers more often!  Sometimes an answer is just ""No you can't"" like my recent answer here and that's about it. But that is the actual, correct answer!  A good rule I use is try not to recommend the 'nuclear option' as your first advice, it happens a fair bit. My SMS is not sending, factory reset. The brightness is too low, Factory Reset!  This answer I'm writing here is a good example of something that borders on a comment, but in the spirit of things I'm adding it as an answer! "
238,"Sounds like something that would be quite useful. If it were one App per Answer, then each app could be individually voted up/down as well as comments left against it...so each answer in itself is useful..."
1166,"If you click the ""help"" link next to a comment box, you'll get a popup with the following information: Comments use mini-Markdown formatting: [link]( _italic_ **bold**&grave;code&grave;. The post author will always be notified of your comment. To also notify a previous commenter, mention their user name: @peter or @PeterSmith will both work. Learn more… If you follow the ""Learn more..."" link you'll get more information about formatting comments than you would think there would be."
488,"I really like the design - very clean &amp; elegant. It does occasionally feel a little bit washed out / monochrome however. I'm sure there are specific elements that could be a bit darker or more colourful without changing the overall elegant feel. I think the most constructive thing to do would be to try and identify specific elements like this, as GAThrawn did here. A few more little accents and highlights like this and I'm sure it would all click together beautifully!"
367,"You could find one of their posts and leave an ""@name"" comment for them on their post. This should then appear as a notification for them next time they're on the site, but this isn't a forum or a chatroom, so that should be used sparingly. Perhaps that could be used to invite them to the Android room on  where you can actually have a real talk, and possibly swap enough contact details that you could then have a private conversation."
603,"Most of the text isn't bold for me? None of the body text in people's questions and answers is (except where sections have been deliberately bolded). Questions titles are, warnings are and some of the stats bits around the edge of the page are, but nothing much else is. What browser are you using and on what operating system? Can you post a screenshot showing which bits are bold that you don't think should/need to be?"
1836,"Assuming the instructions for the other device don't apply, downvote. The downvote tooltip says: This answer is not useful Giving instructions for another device that won't work for the device asked about seems pretty ""not useful"" to me. If you're feeling kind, also (or instead) leave a comment saying so. ""These instructions are for the HTC Foo. They won't work for the Samsung Baz, which is what was asked about."""
840,"It might save you some time spent writing these posts if you search the big parent Meta site,   Questions there tagged ""FAQ"" may be particularly useful, e.g., How do comment @replies work?  That should cover this :)"
