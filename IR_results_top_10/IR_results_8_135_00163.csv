22,"I say yes, if they are phrased properly. ""What is the best app?"" is not a good question, but ""What is the best app in the category Y?""(like email, notes, or fart-noise-making) is very appropriate."
822,"I normally save the &lt; kbd > tags for actual hardware buttons (or at least buttons that are normally hardware even if they're sometimes soft) like Power, Menu, Home, Back, etc. For menu options and clicking on items on the screen I'd normally either bold them (or for long options like descriptions on tick boxes ""enclose them in quotes"". So for your example I'd say Settings -> About phone -> Android version Or Settings -> Display -> tick ""Auto-rotate screen"" Or giving a Xoom the ""three-fingered salute"" would be hold down Power + Volume Up at the same time."
2232,"I don't know if there is general SE guidance on this, but I would say yes &mdash; clear cut cases seem like a good place for flags.  This site is not at the point where moderators need to heavily triage flags, as yet.  That said, I also go fully through most queues regularly, so a flag is not strictly necessary."
2405,"I think it's important to look past the words the questioner happened to use, to see what the intent of the questioner is, and I wish close-voters would put a little more thought into that. This isn't 3-2-1, and you shouldn't lose everything just because you happened to use the magic word ""app"" in your question. Recommendation questions are opinion-based. They ask for lists of answers, and they tend to get spam answers as a result. The answers are less useful than Google Play search results, because they go out of date quickly. This is why we don't like them on the site. Which is the best music player? or Is there a good third-party SMS app? These are simplified examples of bad questions. What kind of answer will they get? A million answers saying ""I like such-and-such app, it's the best"" with no justification. An answer with a one-off copy-paste of Izzy's app lists, which will slowly go out of date or need editors to keep updating it over time. I have a bunch of CSV files in Google Drive and I need to download them when they change and add the results up. Is there an app for that? or I play games on my tablet with my kid ""helping"" sitting on my knee. He often grabs the rim of the tablet and pokes the volume button and makes it really loud. I need the volume buttons turned off when I'm playing a game. Is there an app for that? This doesn't seem like a ""recommendation"" question to me. What kind of answer will it get? There still might be more than one. It might say, ""Use such-and-such app, it can do this out of the box,"" but more likely, it'll say ""You have to install Pushbullet or IFTTT to find out when the file changes, then use Tasker to schedule downloading them and open Excel for Android to load the CSV files,"" or ""You need a custom ROM for this. Lineage can do it."" The difference is, you can replace ""Is there an app?"" with ""How do I solve my problem?"" without really changing the meaning of the question. In the recommendation questions, you can't do that. I think that's the crucial difference. If I find a question like this second pair of examples in the close vote queue, I'll typically make that edit so that people don't close the question, but I don't think the edit should be needed. Just because someone thought an app is the most likely solution to their problem, that doesn't turn a good problem-solving question into a recommendation question. I think we should all apply that test in our head: can I replace ""is there an app?"" with ""is there a solution?"" without changing the meaning of the question."
1303,"It won't work. Like we all do with EULAs, they'll tick the box without reading and keep going.  If there's any fanciness like a timer or making sure they scroll the page, they'll just cheat it and still not read it. There are already lots of pointers to the FAQ and asking guidelines when you post here for the first time.  (Log out and take a look!)  We can do our best to make sure that content is available and helpful, but we can't do anything about the users who refuse to make use of it. See also: Add &quot;I have read the FAQ&quot; check box to the Ask Question page among many others."
1152,"Yes, why not. There's no reason why we shouldn't opt-in. If Android likes to be cool, why its Enthusiasts can't. Go for it without turning back..."
926,"If you go to your reputation page in your profile and scroll all the way to the bottom, there should be a little checkbox labelled ""show removed posts"". Check that and you will see any posts that affected your reputation by virtue of their deletion. In your case, the +1 is likely from an answer that you downvoted which was then subsequently deleted, either by the owner or by a moderator. You get the 1 rep cost of the downvote back when the answer is deleted."
1695,Merged the first two. Not sure about system-partition and partition as the are not semantically equal. I'd like to hear a few more voices on that.
699,"In going back through the unanswered questions, the following twelve seemed to be more likely to garner a response or interest from average user types.  "
1485,"I agree with GAThrawn, that the rule is simply ""if it's asked from a developer's perspective then the question is off-topic on Android Enthusiasts.""  I like to add that it is not always easy to say which questions are clearly developer questions and which are power end-users ones. I'd like to see more tolerance for the later ones. But the mentioned question from OP is simply off-topic according the above rule. On a side note: Maybe it would be a good idea to fill the gap between Android Enthusiasts (end-users) and stackoverflow (developers). ATM the gap is filled by external sites like XDA. But I really like the idea of a SX site for non Android API programming and Android internals questions, something like the proposed Android Internals."
