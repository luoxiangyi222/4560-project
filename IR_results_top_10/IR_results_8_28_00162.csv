1300,"We had similar questions like this one on meta before. We already have such a development tag, but it's not really successful in preventing from dev questions pooping up. Liam's idea seems sophisticated but is also complex and not easy to implement. (Also note that it's already possible to blacklist tags). But all in all I think the ""vote close review queue"" does the job pretty will. It seldom takes longer then a day, mostly just a few hours, before a development question is closed. I think that's the best we can get atm without doing some fancy stuff that may be not usable along the other sites."
8,"Unless/until the Android Developers suggestion at Area 51 takes off, I think SO should be used for development questions."
312,"We can now at least use direct links to Market apps that use a normal URL scheme and will work as links on both the phone and your PC.  No need to use a market://.... link, we can use   Eg this link should take you to the app's Market page on a normal web browser, and if clicked from an Android browser should take you into the app's page in the Market app:  What's more the Android market web pages even have a QR code on them. Anyone know if there'd be a problem embedding the QRs from the Market server in here, they use the normal Ggoogle Charts API to create the QR, like this: |0&amp;cht=qr&amp;chl=http%3A%2F%2Fmarket.android.com%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.rovio.angrybirds Which in an image link gives us:  Which should all be a lot more useful (and less confusing to the casual visitor) than sending someone to Appbrain, or the like."
1490,"I think it might be beneficial to make the wording of the first one more broadly applicable than just ""software development questions"". Something like: Questions about writing and publishing Android apps, writing custom ROMs, and other topics that are primarily of concern to developers are off-topic. Consider taking advantage of other resources that may be appropriate for your question. The reason I'm inclined to link to Where can I ask questions that aren&#39;t Android Enthusiast questions? instead of SO directly is that there are things in that statement (publishing and such) that SO would likely close as well."
1303,"It won't work. Like we all do with EULAs, they'll tick the box without reading and keep going.  If there's any fanciness like a timer or making sure they scroll the page, they'll just cheat it and still not read it. There are already lots of pointers to the FAQ and asking guidelines when you post here for the first time.  (Log out and take a look!)  We can do our best to make sure that content is available and helpful, but we can't do anything about the users who refuse to make use of it. See also: Add &quot;I have read the FAQ&quot; check box to the Ask Question page among many others."
1514,"It looks like the votes tab only shows details for votes to questions and answers still in existance. That is, deleted questions/answers are removed from the votes tab and also change the tally on that page. However, the Stack Exchange database still keeps track of your votes on deleted items and counts that toward the total votes needed for a badge. It also shows this accurate total on the summary profile page. I think that the votes page should show a correct total, perhaps distinguishing between available and deleted votes."
1485,"I agree with GAThrawn, that the rule is simply ""if it's asked from a developer's perspective then the question is off-topic on Android Enthusiasts.""  I like to add that it is not always easy to say which questions are clearly developer questions and which are power end-users ones. I'd like to see more tolerance for the later ones. But the mentioned question from OP is simply off-topic according the above rule. On a side note: Maybe it would be a good idea to fill the gap between Android Enthusiasts (end-users) and stackoverflow (developers). ATM the gap is filled by external sites like XDA. But I really like the idea of a SX site for non Android API programming and Android internals questions, something like the proposed Android Internals."
2333,"I don't actually participate on the main site much, so I held my tongue the first the first few times I saw this question, but... disallowing developing-on-Android questions simply because of the word ""development"" feels like an incredibly prescriptivist view of the rules to me. Setting aside the the specific main site post that led to this question, and looking at the general case: this site is for people who are using Android devices, rather than developing for Android devices. Whether writing a program on an Android device, playing a game on an Android device or watching a movie on an Android device, the person involved is acting as a user of the device, not a developer of that device. For all we know, the development taking place may not be for that device at all, or even be mobile-related; after a few minutes of searching, I found Android-based IDEs for C++, JavaScript and C#."
1488,"From what I've seen of questions asked by developers having issue with the Play Store, most of the questions would be closed in any event, simply because (I'll see if I can dig up some examples, but it'll take time.) Further, would any of these questions have people who could answer them? We only have a few developers here; I expect most questions will remain neglected and unanswered. Granted, this last is a chicken-and-egg problem, but would developers come here and happily co-exist with Android users?  And what about the slippery-slope issue of, ""Well, you let me ask about Play Store Analytics for my app. Why won't you let me ask coding questions? All the developers are here anyway..."" I think, were we to change our policy, we'd end up with something like what we have with rooting/modding questions. Yes, we have a bunch, and some have good answers, but the really good information is elsewhere, and we're mostly just a gateway to that information. Only worse."
369,"Now that the Market has launched as a website explicitly available to both phones and PCs, where the  link will take you to the webpage on a PC, or straight into the relevant page in the Market app on a phone, this probably isn't necessary any more. See also QR Code generator"
