1577,"4.3 hasn't seen much action (it hasn't been long), but the questions for 4.1 and 4.2 each have over 20k views. By comparison, the average question got less than 1.8k views in the last year (my calculation assumes no older questions got views, which is obviously wrong). There are definitely problems with these questions but besides being massive drivers of traffic, they're also pretty highly voted.  People want them. I see the direction Google is going, but I don't think we should follow suit until our audience does."
1936,"The more appropriate close reason for the current and previous revision of the post might be ""primarily opinion based"". You could argue that one could collect statistics about which manufacturers upgrade the most often, and so on, but it's a rather complicated endeavor.  Within specific time periods and device lines you're going to find wildly different information, and none of it is useful going forward because there are simply no set-in-stone policies here.  We want questions to be useful to future readers without their answers needing to be revised all the time. Ultimately it still seems like a shopping advice question, or at least suffers from the same issues as those questions. I can't comment on the views of the other mods, but upon logging in today I found that all of them had viewed your post and declined to take action which is why I dismissed your flag."
1682,"The +100 rep association bonus is not counted in the protection algorithm. The post notice states (emphasis added): To answer it, you must have earned at least 10 reputation on this site. and the ""on this site"" part is actually quite literal, though not entirely clear. Therefore, looking at your rep history, you've got +100 for the association bonus and +5 for an upvote on one of your questions. That nets you 5 rep from your activities on this site, which is still shy of the 10 needed. There is also a more detailed explanation of the ""protected"" status on Meta Stack Exchange, for reference. In this specific case, the view count of the question is pretty low, so I'm going to remove the protection. It looks like it was applied because it picked up a bunch of non-answers within the first 24 hours, but then the views petered off after that."
1536,"The rep required to view the First Posts review queue was bumped from 125 rep to 500 rep on July 26th. You had enough rep to view it under the old rules but do not any longer. The original suggestion, along with some of the reasons why the SE team chose to move this to 500 rep, can be found in this answer on MSO."
2459,"Judging by the number of low-quality deleted answers on this question, it's just a question that has been high in Google search results for a long time. Such questions are most likely to attract spam answers because spammers want to attack the pages that get most views, or that show up in searches for their spam keywords. You'll notice some similarities between the ""helpful"" content of the spam answers - most likely, both were copied from the same source of generic advice. The third post you quote is the same kind of spam comment you can see on any blog nowadays."
228,"Here was an interesting little experiment: Is there a Word Lens alternative/port for Android? I knew that ""Word Lens"" was a hot topic yesterday, and that question it turned out to be the most viewed post yesterday.  In fact it's gotten 219 views in the last 20 hrs where as the next most recent post to get 200 views was asked on the 8th, taking a week and a half to get to 282 views.  Of the most popular search terms that brought people here over the last day ""word lens android"" got 90 and the next most popular was Samsung i5500 2.2 with 6 visits.   Now as far as questions, this wasn't the best one on the site, and it probably wasn't very useful to building membership because people probably came here found that there is no such app and left.   The value of the experiment is that it goes to show how being mindful of whats trending and making good titles with good keywords is helpful in getting people here.  Now ideally if we are to seed questions based on hot topics they'd actually be useful (Like Al's ""When will my phone get Android 2.x?"" questions) so when they get here they find some value and stay.  "
212,"The search engine answer seems the most likely. I know that when I've done a quick Google on answers for some of the slightly obscure questions here, the question itself often shows up in the top 5 Google results. Also, have a look at the questions with the most views, like the Galaxy S GPS problems one. These have thousands of views, and lots of replies from users with just one rep point, that smacks of people who've just found the page through a search engine when they're trying to find the solution to a problem they're having, but aren't sticking around and using the rest of the site."
512,"I think the idea of StackExchange sites is that you should be voting on the answer of its own merits, not on the merits of who posted it. Easily following a user would more open up the system for ""gaming"" where people follow their friend|enemies and upvote|downvote. This is possible by going into a user's profile and looking at their questions and answers, but it isn't quite as exposed. But people do come with baggage -- we are more inclined to view the answer from a person with 12.6K rep as more authoritative than from somebody with 126 rep. Even though the latter might have given a better answer. But the goal is to vote answers for their own merits."
1258,"Please note the last criterium alone is not enough, as it might turn out to apply more broadly. That's why it should not be closed immediately but first watched for ""access"" (views) and, maybe, comments pointing to that direction."
1016,"This is a new and interesting feature that allows users to spend less effort while doing their part to this community network. The new feature, as any other feature comes with potential bad habits that one may get caught in without noticing. Some that I've noticed across SE are: Clicker happy Experienced users or new users all get involved in such a way that may forget about the real purpose of the review area. Take you time, analyze what you are reviewing: Is there an actual “accept ALL the suggested edits” problem? The usage for competition One interesting part of the new review is that we are able to view who's the top reviewer, what position are we in, and even compare decisions by looking at the review history.  This serves the purpose of providing users a way to improve themselves and refrain from committing mistakes, by learning with others. It is not the Olympic Games, there's no fat payment for the first place, so, don't go voting just because! Vote and review always with the community shirt on. Exaggerated point of view One may get addicted, and as any addiction, there are side effects. If you're tired of seeing what you consider bad answers or bad questions, take a break from review, use the chat to exchange ideas, post a question at META to clarify you point of view. Remember the famous: Could we please be a bit nicer to new users? Don't spend your precious time reviewing just to feel tired and saturated. I'm answering this as to illustrate some of the frequent problems I see on the several SE sites, being discussed on META, and even some that I've personally experienced and/or have been confronted by. Feel free to improve it."
