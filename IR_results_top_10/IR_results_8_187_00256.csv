666,"Not sure about smartphones. But there is also tablet, so maybe it makes sense to keep the smartphone tag also. I am in favor of blacklisting mobile-phones and cellphones. Matthew is right: If the phone functionality in question is calling, calls is the tag to go. And for everything else, mobile-phones and cellphones is to broad and inaccurate."
615,"I think it makes a lot of sense to split these up sensibly, I'd propose something like this Do we really need an app-blocking tag? The one question that I think you're nominating for it, is really a PC question rather than an Android one (and quite an edge case even there) I'd think it would be better off on SuperUser than here, and even then I think ""locking"" is probably closer to what is happening than blocking (seems to be to do with locked handles on mounted drives/files).  *I'd think that call-blocking should be set to a synonym of call-screening (as surely blocking is just a type of screening where you don't allow the call through after screening it). One of the call-screening questions even mentions blocking in the title."
654,"call-log, call-logs, call-logging -> call-history history was removed, browser-history created logcat -> logging, which is now used for system and other miscellaneous logging logs was removed, I figure it's too ambiguous to be merged with anything else"
1803,"I'm terrible at naming things like this, but a lot of the other chat rooms use amusing names to try to mix things up. One that popped into my head was something like: The Candy Shop A chat room for Android users to discuss devices, apps, the latest Android news and gossip, and how many warranties they've voided. Something that plays with the idea of Android releases being named after deserts and such. The description is intended to be a little more friendly but also informational. We probably do need to be conscious of the fact that the room listings only get you 40-50 characters before they truncate (you can see the full description by viewing the room info, though). Therefore, keeping the word ""users"" (or something like that) near the front of the description might be a good idea. Also, by not calling it ""Android"" we might help prevent people with programming questions from getting sucked in."
129,"Definitely something funny with search, I see no results searching for ""google earth""  Even though there's a question with those words in that order in the title, a tag called google-earth, and I can remember seeing another couple of questions lately that reference Google Earth in the main question text."
711,Q: How can I prevent my screen from turning off while on a phone call? (Sep 2011)
867,"I'd be careful about merging the 'contacts' and 'people'. Isn't the app in HTC Sense called ""People""?  Also, 2.x and 3.x versions of Android are going to be around (and generating questions) for quite some time yet. I think Matthew Read's suggestion of creating ""contacts-app"" and ""people-app"" is a good one, although I don't think I'm in favor of making one a synonym of the other. They will at least offer a way to distinguish from questions about contacts in general."
836,"It was tried, sort of.  There used to be something called Flag Weight that was similar to reputation, and some users enjoyed the ""game"" of trying to increase it.  It had some problems, though &mdash; it punished good flaggers disproportionately for mistakes, and complaints about rejected flags were constant.  There's still a count of helpful flags on your profile page though, and there are badges for flagging (e.g., Marshal). IMO we don't have a problem with not enough flags, so encouraging it further is unnecessary given the potential downsides."
493,"I think a big issue is going to be finding relevant conferences. Google IO sold out in a ridiculously short time, plus I'm pretty sure they don't put out a call for speakers. AnDevCon was OK, but I was pretty disappointed in it as an advanced Android user/developer. Might need to look to some more general conferences such as MADExpo which I saw advertised on MSDN. After a conference is found, finding a speaker shouldn't be a problem: there are plenty of Android fans and developers with plenty to say."
1100,"There's no difference between RAM and memory (in or out the questions) RAM is sometimes called ""memory"" for short which further complicates
  the issue. RAM is a computer chip that assists in speed of the
  computer that is measured in Megabytes (MB) or Gigabyte (GB) depending
  on the size of the chip. When a user chooses to open a file, the
  computer must put that information somewhere to be able to access it.
  It writes the file temporarily to the RAM for easy access. RAM also
  temporarily saves files that are currently being worked on. So I agree with you that they should be merged."
