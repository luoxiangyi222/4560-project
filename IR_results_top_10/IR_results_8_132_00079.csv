90,You start with 1 reputation point. If you link your user account to an account on another Stack Exchange site you get a free 100 point bonus. Thus 101 reputation without asking any questions or giving any answers. Update: Note that the account you link to has to have a minimum amount of reputation itself (200+) or you don't get the bonus. The thinking is that if you're a good contributor on another site that will likely be true on this one as well.  Linked account didn&#39;t get 100 rep points
1494,"This question is about unauthorized copying of apps, or otherwise violating software copyright. For legal reasons, and to support the Android ecosystem, we don't accept questions that facilitate piracy. We don't get that many piracy questions, but there are occasional ones, so we might as well be ready for them."
134,"Well, you can tether via USB or bluetooth.  But with separate [wifi] (or [usb] or [bluetooth]) and [tether] tags, that should get the point across"
2411,"I don't think there's any way to get a notification, but after a question is migrated, the original question gets a banner to say what site it was migrated to, with a link to the question on the destination site."
209,"If their answer are not complete, you can also create your own complete answer and accept it. You won't get any rep from it nor will your answer get bumped to the top as a normal accepter answer would be, so I really don't think this is cheating"
2492,"Until they were deleted, your question had net 0 votes and your answer to that question had net -1 votes. To get Peer Pressure badge, your post must have -3 votes at least.  Now I wouldn't encourage you to get this badge by making low quality posts. That badge is something that must not be a goal of anybody here. If you're into badges, there are plenty of them which requires positive contribution to this website and are easy to get. Ideally, we hope that users contribute to this site without explicitly aiming for badges only. "
178,"I have two concerns. One, ""intrusive"" is very subjective. What's intrusive for you may not be a big deal for someone else. Second, and more important, is that I think it's too ambitious and doesn't fit in with this site. The number of tablets is going to grow exponentially and, unless someone is really dedicated, your proposed wiki will never be able to keep up. Once it gets out of date by more than a couple months, it will have lost most of its utility. Plus it has the potential to get really huge. This is the sort of thing that Wikipedia does well. Let them. "
475,"Sure. There are plenty of great topics for blog posts that can hopefully go far above and beyond being a mere reference answer for common questions If this gets traction, coordinate with rebecca@stackexchange.com and she can get a provisional blog set up."
1798,"One more argument in addition to eldarerathis' answer: Downvotes are not intended to punish the poster, but to cause him to improve his post. If he does, you can take back your downvote (and get your rep back). If it was a real bad post, and receives enough downvotes (or attention from our mods/high-reppers [not ""high rappers"" :)]), the post gets deleted. In such a case, all ""down-voters"" get their ""lost rep"" back as well – provided the deletion happens in a given time-frame. I don't remember the exact numbers here; but if the post only gets deleted a year later, the rep stays lost. Remains the question: Does it make sense to down-vote a post of a user just having 1 rep? He won't see (or feel) that. You only can lose rep if you've got some (which as down-voter, you have). But see previous paragraph: Given enough down-votes, a special user called ""Community"" (which even has mod status) automatically deletes such a post – and once more, you regain your ""lost rep"". Thus it makes pretty much sense for e.g. spam and offending posts, to speed up their ""demise""."
565,"Gaming has gotten great traffic via asking users who get a new game to post as many questions as they can.  This provides the benefits of seeding (more questions) without the drawbacks (crappy, contrived questions) since the questions are intended to be about actual problems the gamers encounter.  It's simply prompting them to ask the question on Gaming rather than trying to solve the problem on their own.  Having so many questions about the game on the day of release and thereafter means that Gaming gets a huge chunk of the search traffic for the game. We could try a similar thing when Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) is released.  Everyone with a flagship device could upgrade immediately and start asking questions, as could anyone who gets a new device with the OS.  Probably it won't work as well as on Gaming, but it's sure to be better than nothing."
