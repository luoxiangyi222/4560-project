2015,"As already mentioned on Matthew's comment, ""How to use the limited set of operations provided by a particular app to calculate arcsin"" is a math question. Everything you just described is about math. If you want a calculator app with more operations then you should use one. Basically, the issues are: The first question is a legit question and actually answerable (answer: there's no operator to do that, install 3rd-party calculator instead).  However, you dragged our attention to the second question, which is unclear and off-topic:"
1162,The flavor of Markdown that Stack Exchange uses doesn't support this. I would be against it in any case. Underlines are very commonly understood to indicate links when on web sites. You mess with this very basic and well-understood UI element at your peril. (I can't tell you how many times I've been on some web site and tried to click underlined text and nothing happened.) See also: Why can we format text with bold and italic but not underline? It's been brought up before and unless you can devise a compelling new argument it's not going to be implemented.
334,"I think the question to ask is, can this be generalized to help others in the future, and if so, how much? Otherwise it's basically a shopping question: "
783,"Sounds good to me, and I agree that individual requests are basically shopping recs.  I went ahead and created the question: Where can I find stock or custom ROMs for my Android device?"
400,"It is, basically, a measure of how trustworthy your ""flags"" are. That is, what priority posts get when you flag them for moderator attention. The higher the number, the greater weight your flags are given. FAQ: What is 'flag weight'?"
972,"Both underscores and asterisks work for italics, it has nothing at all to do with the button.  Basically you've confused the parser that converts the Markdown to HTML. You have to escape the underscore with a backslash: *kernel\_config.gz* Which shows as: kernel_config.gz"
2035,"What is the actual use in grouping phones by chipset?  This site is for end-users, there is going to be virtually nothing relevant in common between two phones from different manufacturers than both happen to include MediaTek chips."
475,"Sure. There are plenty of great topics for blog posts that can hopefully go far above and beyond being a mere reference answer for common questions If this gets traction, coordinate with rebecca@stackexchange.com and she can get a provisional blog set up."
192,"It's basically asking us to parse the news for the asker. As opposed to any other question that is asking us to parse [google|internet|personal experience] ? But speculative questions have no one right answer until the future is past. In that sense, they may be worse than community wiki."
1773,"Custom flags (those raised using the ""other"" reason) are intended for things that cannot ordinarily be handled by the community. These flags go directly to the moderators, whereas other flags will go into various review queues that can be acted upon by other users of the site. Someone saying ""thanks"" is simply not something that is generally going to require direct moderator intervention. It is not actively harmful to the site, and there are tools already available to you that are appropriate for the situation: Secondly, as Dan alludes to in his answer, if you do use the ""other"" flag reason, you need to be really, excruciatingly specific in your message. Your flag is basically telling us ""Hey, something is wrong, and I, as a regular user, am unable to handle it with the current tools. I need a moderator!"" Entering your flag description as ""saying thanks"" doesn't provide us with enough information to act on. In the context of this flag, you actually raised two separate flags on the same post, one minute apart from each other. The first is the flag you noted above. The second was a flag on one of the comments on the post. Moderators cannot respond to comment flags, so we had to respond to the post flag instead, which appeared to be connected in purpose to your comment flag based on the timestamp and the content of each flag."
