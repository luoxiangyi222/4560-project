1118,"Just because a question is Closed doesn't mean that it is locked away forever. Being Closed gives the original author (and others) an opportunity to improve the question and, hopefully, get it re-opened. If you believe that the questions are not essentially the same, then please edit your question to make that distinction. It would be a good idea to link to the other question and explain why yours isn't a duplicate. If the community agrees, those with enough Reputation points can vote to re-open. If that process seems slow, you can Flag the question for a Moderator and explain that you've edited the question to make it clear it's not a duplicate. Or, you could raise the issue here (as you've done) but without making the edits to distinguish the questions it might not go very far."
2035,"What is the actual use in grouping phones by chipset?  This site is for end-users, there is going to be virtually nothing relevant in common between two phones from different manufacturers than both happen to include MediaTek chips."
792,"I am very unlikely to root my device, so I don't really have any skin in this game. That said, I do believe the current canonical question is getting too big and unwieldy. I think ""How do I root device X"" or, even better, ""How do I root Y class of devices"" is a good way to go. I'm concerned, though, about the different ways one can root a device. I would caution against ANY ""how do I root device X with method Y"" questions. I also agree with Flow in that these shouldn't automatically go to Community Wiki. It will take work to put this information together; the people who do should get the reward. We also have a slew of closed questions that can be re-opened and answered. That should make the askers happy. (Although that's not a reason to do this.)"
193,"I'm pretty open to what I consider useful subjective questions, but this doesn't query the communities Android expertise or any information about using or getting the most out of and Android device, it is just question for newsers and android blog enthusiasts.  I think this is off topic.  Asking, ""Will my XXX phone be able to use Verizon's LTE network"" is a good question. "
2617,"I don't think so; such questions are broad, open ended and don't have a definitive best answer. Therefore, they're not a good fit for Stack Exchange's Q&amp;A format. See also the Help Center article What types of questions should I avoid asking?: You should only ask practical, answerable questions based on actual problems that you face. Chatty, open-ended questions diminish the usefulness of our site and push other questions off the front page. Your questions should be reasonably scoped. If you can imagine an entire book that answers your question, youâ€™re asking too much. Older Stack Exchange might still have some of these questions, but they're often locked and they're just kept for reference and not for maintenance."
2089,"I too think it is pretty much off-topic. Example 1: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one should I buy? We simply can't know the expectations and parameters of choice of any person. Example 2: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one is
better? Since utility of a good is not quantifiable, the answers are going to be pretty much subjective and opinion-based. Example 3: I want a phone with following specs: blablabla Can you guys suggest any? There are websites that find phones with the desired specs already."
1008,Seems good to me; this is done.
949,This is done. I ended up performing the following steps:
888,"Why not create fm-radio as well, retag the existing radio and radio-firmware questions as necessary, and make radio synonym to one of the tags (not sure which one should be most appropriate, probably fm-radio since it's most commonly associated with ""radio"" out of context). cellular-radio is also a good idea, although I am not a big fan of tag proliferation."
1516,"This is quite possibly my fault (though the system should probably handle it better). At the end of last week How do you link to applications in the Android market? came up in my Close Votes queue as a dupe of How to post a link to an android market app? but after looking at the two questions, it was obvious that one had old, out-of-date and (now-)incorrect answers (one answer was by me) whereas the other one had answers that are current and correct. In my opinion the Close As Dupe vote had been cast on the wrong question (based on which one had the currently good answers) so I ""Leave Open"" voted the one and I submitted the first VtC on the other. Having explained what I did though, the system really should show what's going on in a clearer manner, and handle the situation where one is Closed as a Dupe while the other is still in the vote to close phase."
