30,"My opinion: If the question specifies how an app would be ""like"" X, as in providing a list of required features/constraints, then that's OK. But in that case, you don't really need the ""App X"" in there.  I suppose it doesn't hurt, but you could just say ""I'm looking for an app with these 10 features."" Unless these questions are significantly constrained, there's no appreciable difference between them and What X app should I get? questions.  I'd at least be suspicious of any and all questions taking this format, as they are likely to be treated as polls."
41,"I would say yes. Certainly for built-in and Google applications. For more obscure application maybe not, but those are less likely to get answers anyways"
277,"It looks like Bryan Denny's How do I root my phone? would be a perfect place to consolidate this, and a great resource to point all the rooting question-askers at. If he's happy for his answer to be Community Wiki'd, then it could be treated as a shared resource to put all the info in, the same way that the ""When is my phone getting [OS]"" questions are pointed to the two ""When will my phone get the Android 2.2 update (FroYo)?"" (and Gingerbread) questions started by Al Everett. That way all of the normal ""How Do I Root"" questions can be closed and pointed to Bryan's question, and the more unusual edge-cases can be treated on a case-by-case basis to see if they'll stand as their own separate question (but probably still with a link back to the main rooting question),"
186,"Don't post an answer that should be a comment. ""Me too"" answers will (eventually) get deleted and, as you've noticed, the community doesn't like them (hence the downvotes). To gain reputation: Ask good questions; make good answers. You're not the only one who is occasionally frustrated with the rep limits for activities on the beta sites. I've seen several such questions on  On the plus side, you'll get those reputation points back when your downvoted answer is deleted."
2411,"I don't think there's any way to get a notification, but after a question is migrated, the original question gets a banner to say what site it was migrated to, with a link to the question on the destination site."
271,"Seems like a good idea, and reminds me of...  Which starts with Thank you for your confidence in our abilities! But have you read the Stack Overflow FAQ? We get a lot of IT/network/computer/technical questions on here, but Stack Overflow is meant to be first and foremost a programmer's resource. Yes, someone here might be able to help you, but you'll find that other forums more focused on your topic can give you a much better answer than a bunch of programmers. It's likely that your question will be downvoted, closed, and in some cases marked &quot;offensive.&quot; It's not that we hate you, it's just that we're programmers and we like to keep our corn pops separate from our cocoa puffs. I can see an android-flavored version of that getting plenty of traction."
581,"I guess I fall into the ""middle class"" type of user (at the moment). I like to think I'm being generally helpful and contributing, but there's definitely a large, empty gap in the middle rep ranges which I've wondered about for a while. I'm going to go ahead and throw out a couple of things I've personally observed which have a negative impact on the number of available answerable questions. I don't claim any kind of statistical backing to any of this, mind you: That said, I also think that it's somewhat hard to attract real power users to a Q&amp;A site like this. Now I'm not saying we can't or that we should give up because I really enjoy having Android Enthusiasts around, but the nature of the beast is that much of what happens on e.g. XDA is very discussion based. There's a lot of trial and error, people experimenting with things and almost bricking their phones then collaborating on solutions, and developers putting out bleeding-edge stuff for others to test and give feedback on. We just can't cater to that here, and I think it does affect our userbase to some extent. Is it necessarily a bad thing? No, I don't think so. I'm personally glad to be able to come here when I have a question so that I can ask it without it getting lost in a sea of discussion and just get answers. I do think that it's a little bit of a handicap, though. That turned out to be a bit more lengthy than I intended, but that's my $0.02."
311,"I don't think that's necessary. For one thing it's not a change that would be all that universal. What use would, say, English.SE have for QR codes? Besides, the new web market puts QR codes right on the page. It's only a couple of clicks to get the URL for the image and add it to a message. "
241,"Only if the person who originally posted it comes back and asks for the question to be linked to their new account. (I did that.) But Louis has a good suggestion. I don't know what the thinking is for questions that are not likely to be ever answered and certainly never have an answer accepted. I suppose we could discuss getting rid of them on a case-by-case basis. Of course, you could always upvote an answer; then it won't appear in the ""Unanswered"" list."
633,"I'm getting one and hope to be asking questions here.  Bryan and GAThrawn have explained why. A minor note: Until it's actually released, I expect we won't be accepting questions about it &mdash; the only ones we could answer with certitude pertain to the information Amazon has publicly released.  Just like with Ice Cream Sandwich, we won't speculate or post answers that say ""go look at this thing Eric Schmidt / Jeff Bezos said""; premature questions generally get closed. Just something to keep in mind before you migrate :)"
