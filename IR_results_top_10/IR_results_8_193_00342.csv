399,"My part in that conversation started because travis said that his phone had the same problem as the OP's, so at first I was trying to find a common thread between their two devices. If they were both running ROMs running Sense UI that would suggest that perhaps it wasn't necessarily a hardware-specific issue and those of us trying to help should focus more on their particular firmwares and not just the phones themselves.  When travis said he didn't know I wanted to try to be clear when explaining to him what he needed to know in order to give me a useful answer. I hope that clarifies my seemingly off-topic comments.  :)"
393,"I think for that particular question it's okay. The issue doesn't appear to be device specific, so the steps JonnyP is suggesting should help both people. If Travis had opened a new question, we almost certainly would have closed it as a duplicate of this question. That's not to say that it's okay to hijack someone else's question, but that in this case I don't think it's out-of-bounds."
1615,"The first thing to understand was that this Stack Exchange site graduated from beta to a full site two and a half years ago. The design was set up at that time, and at that time Android v3.x aka Honeycomb was the newest version of the Android OS. You can see the thoughts from Jin, Stack Exchange's designer in this post: Design ideas for Android.se Site. (follow-up design talks: Design mockups for final site theme, New Design Launched &amp; Roboto is the new Droid. The honeycomb-ed background is obviously based on the idea of Android Honeycomb, and in my opinion is nicely understated, just adding a bit of texture to the page. It's also  physically isolated from the input boxes, which are either surrounded by white or black, so I'm not sure what the relevance of being nearly the same colour as the border of the input box has? You could certainly make an argument that Honeycomb is a fairly old version of Android now, but at the same time re-designing the site every time a new version of Android releases is probably a bit more work than Stack Exchange have time for while they're still busy launching new sites every month, all with their own unique designs. The ""green-ish question title and other texts"" points exactly to Android, for the reason that you yourself mention, that green colour is #A4C639. this Meta site is not using Android's bot logo properly If you have a look around the Stack Exchange network, ""meta"" sites always use a desaturated/greyed-out/monochrome version of the main site's theme. The site/Android logo on the main Android.SE site is based on #A4C639, the logo for the meta site is just  a grey version of the same logo. Android's branding guidelines allow for this sort of modification, monochrome-ing a logo is very different from making it pink with yellow polka-dots. that said, do you have any specific suggestions for how these things could be improved?"
1660,"Somehow I was on the 'active bounty' thing.  ""There are no questions with an active bounty at the moment.
Perhaps you'd like to select a different tab?"" Should the URL give some clue?"
1828,"If you meant by this,  It actually shows the last activity on that post, excluding the deletion. Most possibly, here is the actual timeline: Hence, it shows Darshak Parikh's answer as the last activity."

1701,"There could be a couple of reasons for this. If you have a specific question in mind that you'd like an explanation for then feel free to point it out and I (or someone else) can take a look, but off the top of my head a few possibilities would be: If the question's last activity is attributed to Community♦ and there are no edits/modifications, then it's often (but not necessarily always) because Community♦ will periodically bump old unanswered questions to the front page, to give them additional visibility. I don't know if this is really explained anywhere, but the profile description for Community♦ does note this. If a question is reopened, it will get bumped to the front page, but there isn't any immediately obvious activity on it. You can see the close/reopen activities in the post's revision history, though. It's possible that someone posted a comment, spam, or other non-answer as an answer, which was then subsequently deleted. You'll still see the activity on the front page of the site, but you won't be able to see the deleted post without 10k reputation, so it will seem like some kind of phantom activity took place. If the account is a spam account, then it may be destroyed, which will attribute the activity (on the front page) to Community♦ instead of the original poster. I may be missing some other situations here as well, but I would say that these are the most common on our site."
895,"From what I've seen this site gets more than its fair share of drive-by readers. So, without even a modicum of reputation points they're not doing any voting. I've not been as active as I would like (for other reasons) but when I am active I try to use up my votes every day. There's often not enough things to vote on, though."
40,"[beta] : Actively participated in the private beta. If I recall correctly from the Web Applications stackexchange beta, these are awarded just a bit after the site goes public beta, once you have actively participated. This site has been running nye on 3 days. It's far, far to early for the beta badge to be awarded."
