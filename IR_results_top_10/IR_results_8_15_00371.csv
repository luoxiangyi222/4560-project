1718,"I think the others covered it well but obviously I should chime in.  Al in particular is correct when he says I should have left it for another mod. The new comment ignored the Meta thread and indicated that they hadn't even read the rest of the comments, which were bad main-site comments anyways that should have come to Meta.  So I pointed out that I had explained my view and where to find it, and deleted the old and oldly-closed question that seemed to remain to only attract bad attention (could be what you mean by ""quite popular""). Also should be noted is that the question already should have been deleted.  I did a bit of our usual delete-old-closed-questions yearly cleanup in January but have had no time to keep going since then."
228,"Here was an interesting little experiment: Is there a Word Lens alternative/port for Android? I knew that ""Word Lens"" was a hot topic yesterday, and that question it turned out to be the most viewed post yesterday.  In fact it's gotten 219 views in the last 20 hrs where as the next most recent post to get 200 views was asked on the 8th, taking a week and a half to get to 282 views.  Of the most popular search terms that brought people here over the last day ""word lens android"" got 90 and the next most popular was Samsung i5500 2.2 with 6 visits.   Now as far as questions, this wasn't the best one on the site, and it probably wasn't very useful to building membership because people probably came here found that there is no such app and left.   The value of the experiment is that it goes to show how being mindful of whats trending and making good titles with good keywords is helpful in getting people here.  Now ideally if we are to seed questions based on hot topics they'd actually be useful (Like Al's ""When will my phone get Android 2.x?"" questions) so when they get here they find some value and stay.  "
349,"You probably had a reputation re-calc. The number on your profile doesn't change immediately when a question or answer (where you had upvotes/downvotes) is deleted. I do know that a number of old, closed, off-topic questions were deleted recently."
104,"Yes, same here on HTC Incredible with default browser. I suggest putting it on SO's meta site since it's probably a problem across all SE sites. It's similar to this question, which unfortunately doesn't seem to have many views. "
2536,"You do not have the privilege to view deleted posts  as of now, otherwise, you could have figured this out yourself. In the last 24 hours, you suffered a loss of 4 points in total, accrued from two suggested edits earlier. The two posts, both questions actually, have been deleted by Community user as part of  deleting abandoned questions. Those two questions were earlier closed, one for being off-topic and the other being unclear, and didn't meet the criteria to stay visible. Deleting a post removes points gained from a suggested edit for that post. Tip: avoid editing blatantly off-topic posts (programming/development related questions), unless for removing personal information, since they should either be closed or be deleted. There is no good reason to improve them. "
2201,"The automated deleter is already very lenient, and only deletes questions which contain content that our contributors have shown aren't useful or relevant to the site. Both of the questions you link have a score of -1. Of the roughly 1000 people who saw each question, nobody thought they were ""useful and clear"", but at least one person thought they were ""unclear or not useful"". They were deleted after three to four months of inactivity. To prevent your questions being deleted, you need to make them more useful, so that other people will vote them up and not down. In this particular case, asking a first question, and then when you found more information, you edited your first question to include ""UPDATE"" and a link to a new question, but no explanation of how the questions related or why you'd done this. If I had seen the two questions, I might have closed the second question as a duplicate of the first anyway. I think that might have caused the downvote in this case, but the misuse of code formatting in your questions might have contributed too. In general, the advice in How do I ask a good question? will help to make sure your questions don't get closed or downvoted, and consequently don't get automatically deleted as ""not useful"". Beeshyams (one of our regular users, who often tries to help track down more complex problems) posted an answer on your second question, but you didn't upvote his answer or give him any feedback, so he deleted the answer himself three weeks later. If you found his answer useful, you could have voted it up, and that would have prevented your question being deleted. The system avoids deleting any content that anyone finds useful. In summary: the deletion bot is called ""Community"" because it reflects the will of the site's community. If you write a question that the community finds useful, it won't be deleted. If someone puts the effort into trying to solve your problem, and that's useful, you need to show it by upvoting. Voting isn't just cosmetic, and it doesn't just give feedback to other people: it also controls the system, by showing it which content we want and which content we don't want."
2533,"I'd start with this: ... as the problem at hand has been fixed ... Yes, if you solved a problem yourself, you're always encouraged to post a self-answer (and accept it if appropriate). The goal of Stack Exchange is to build a library of knowledge to help not only the question asker, but more importantly, all future visitors to the sites. Therefore any potentially useful question and solution (answer) should not be left out just because no one cares at present. It's meant to be valuable to the future. On the other hand, neither option 2 nor option 3 would be appropriate, as the question is of a decent shape and doesn't warrant closure or deletion. Option 1 may be acceptable, but why would you ignore it when there are better options available? :) Congrats on your first self-answer then!  This answer probably looks like an expanded version of Izzy's comment, but I believe that it'd be because this is the general feeling or consensus that the Android Enthusiasts Stack Exchange community would have."
1374,"As I just wondered again about the development tag (and why there are only so few questions tagged such), maybe a sum-up from the above might be helpful: So here's probably the clue why there are always only few questions found using this tag: they simply get deleted :) This way we 10k+ users can use our powers to support our moderators (and) keeping our site clean -- and not only we 10k+, but all users can participate here (e.g. re-tagging does not require a 10k+ but only 500+)."
444,"(Building on my comment on Matthew Read's answer) Since there does seem to be some use to them I propose having tags: windows, linux, and mac.  That way if a user does have a question like syncing, drivers or whatever that does relate - those that have experience with whichever platform can view have it as a favorite or something.  That said I'm not sure how much we really need them since very few questions should apply to these tags, but if we do then those are the three we should have."
