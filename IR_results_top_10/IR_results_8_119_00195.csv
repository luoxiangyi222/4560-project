1162,The flavor of Markdown that Stack Exchange uses doesn't support this. I would be against it in any case. Underlines are very commonly understood to indicate links when on web sites. You mess with this very basic and well-understood UI element at your peril. (I can't tell you how many times I've been on some web site and tried to click underlined text and nothing happened.) See also: Why can we format text with bold and italic but not underline? It's been brought up before and unless you can devise a compelling new argument it's not going to be implemented.

844,"I definitely agree that these are valid concerns. One of our biggest challenges is finding promotions that have an effect. It seems like we've found ways to generate a temporary spike in questions, but that doesn't necessarily translate into users that stick around. Our theory was that if you generate enough spikes, there will be the occasional user that sticks around. I don't think there has been enough time or enough contests to determine whether or not that is true, but I do think that promoting the site through a contest is a good thing, because it makes the site more visible. In other words, it's definitely good to look at how active people are after they enter a contest as one metric, but contests can also attract new users after the fact because of the new content. That being said, it is important to make sure our questions and answers remain high quality, and contests that promote asking bad questions are always bad. That's why we decided to go with views for Audio Week instead of a random drawing. We figured that votes were more easily inflated than views, and that better questions would be clicked on more. However, it might be worthwhile to place more emphasis on votes in the future. Perhaps holding questions to a standard of ""at least a score of 3"" (or 5, or something) would be a better. "
1016,"This is a new and interesting feature that allows users to spend less effort while doing their part to this community network. The new feature, as any other feature comes with potential bad habits that one may get caught in without noticing. Some that I've noticed across SE are: Clicker happy Experienced users or new users all get involved in such a way that may forget about the real purpose of the review area. Take you time, analyze what you are reviewing: Is there an actual “accept ALL the suggested edits” problem? The usage for competition One interesting part of the new review is that we are able to view who's the top reviewer, what position are we in, and even compare decisions by looking at the review history.  This serves the purpose of providing users a way to improve themselves and refrain from committing mistakes, by learning with others. It is not the Olympic Games, there's no fat payment for the first place, so, don't go voting just because! Vote and review always with the community shirt on. Exaggerated point of view One may get addicted, and as any addiction, there are side effects. If you're tired of seeing what you consider bad answers or bad questions, take a break from review, use the chat to exchange ideas, post a question at META to clarify you point of view. Remember the famous: Could we please be a bit nicer to new users? Don't spend your precious time reviewing just to feel tired and saturated. I'm answering this as to illustrate some of the frequent problems I see on the several SE sites, being discussed on META, and even some that I've personally experienced and/or have been confronted by. Feel free to improve it."
1311,"What circumstances is a general all-round ""yes you can"" or ""no you can't"" going to be useful? Are you just going to spend days throwing random commands at your tablet in random ways, or is there something specific that you're trying to do? What are you likely to be doing that has a chance of bricking your device? A question like ""Is there a chance rooting my device using the FancyNamed Rooting Method could brick my device?"" is answerable, (and will probably already be answered on the support thread for which ever rooting method you use). Your question as it is at the moment is very broad, has a lot of unknowns, and isn't really answerable with any answer that will stay the test of time."
596,"I would tend to agree. Go ahead and start hitting that ""edit"" link. I have updated the tag-wiki for pc to direct people to more specific tags. It might help."
1577,"4.3 hasn't seen much action (it hasn't been long), but the questions for 4.1 and 4.2 each have over 20k views. By comparison, the average question got less than 1.8k views in the last year (my calculation assumes no older questions got views, which is obviously wrong). There are definitely problems with these questions but besides being massive drivers of traffic, they're also pretty highly voted.  People want them. I see the direction Google is going, but I don't think we should follow suit until our audience does."
622,"Frankly, I think questions like this should be closed as ""too localized"", but I'm afraid we're going to keep getting them. They're way too localized. Even a question like ""what's new in Android 4.0?"" would be marginal (I'd point them to Wikipedia, I look up what's new in each Google Chrome release on Wikipedia for example). An 2.3.x release on a specific phone model (I'm assuming vendors tweak each release?) is incredibly localized and trivial."
549,"The old way, today not functioning any more: Just append ""mobile/on"" to the base URL of the SE site you want to have mobile skin re-enabled The new and official way as it is today: click on the link ""mobile"" in the footer of the page"
1173,"Based on the screenshot, it looks like you're using the ""collapsed"" view of your profile here at the moment. There should be a link next to your name that says more info. Click on that to expand it, which will reveal additional profile information (including your flag count). "
