1298,"Sounds good to me, except for the case where a user wants to restore their phone to original stock. I feel that asking where to find the stock image is a good question, since stock won't change (while ROMs are constantly created/updated/abandoned)."
2099,"Answers don't determine whether questions are duplicates. If an answer needs updating or another needs to be posted you should do one or all of: However, I'm pretty sure you're not correct about all of those changes since 5.0, since I was able to find and add methods that definitely work on some 5.1 and 6.0 devices.  Try it out. You should also look at my second answer.  This is not supposed to be possible for you to bypass, especially not with a locked bootloader.  That's the entire point of the feature."
533, says they're the same. I'll create synonyms. Update: This is now complete.
850,Who won? It's almost a day since the competition ended :)
2306,"No. If we took that kind of question, we would end up having to create an index of every device and custom ROM there is. Not only that, we'd have to update it with new versions and to replace dead links. There's no way we can maintain that big a collection of links. For this reason, such questions are always closed as a duplicate of Where can I find stock or custom ROMs for my Android device?, which has a list of places where you can find ROMs for various devices."
1309,"I created android-emulator to house all of the questions related to the Android emulator  specifically, then retagged the questions that were about other kinds of emulation. I also re-worked the emulator wiki/excerpt to make it clear that it's for non-Android emulators. If I missed any questions in the retagging, feel free to fix them up."
2392,"This is to inform everyone that I've created tags the following tags: nokia-x
nokia-xl
nokia-x-plus
nokia-2
nokia-3
nokia-5
nokia-6 The nokia was supposed to be created so that when a question is on a new model of Nokia smartphones, there is at least one tag present. But with advice from @Izzy, I didn't create it at the end, keeping in mind that some or the other high reputation users or moderator would create the required tag, if they happen to come across the question. @NVZ has added the tag nokia-8."
276,"I don't think a canonical question will work, unfortunately, since rooting techniques vary wildly across devices (unless I am misunderstanding what a canonical question is).  I think a Community Wiki question work quite well though, with an entry for each device.  Something like: Device X 2.1-eclair Method 1 . Method 2 . 2.2-froyo"
596,"I would tend to agree. Go ahead and start hitting that ""edit"" link. I have updated the tag-wiki for pc to direct people to more specific tags. It might help."
1721,"Your answer became CW because the question was made so after it was posted.  I am not sure why all the answers weren't automatically marked at the time since that's how I understand the process, I will correct that.  Update: Due to a question merge! I do believe the edit was inappropriate as well.  Editing for style preference is discouraged since the post still has your name on it.  Plus it removed information."
