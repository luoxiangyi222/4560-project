822,"I normally save the &lt; kbd > tags for actual hardware buttons (or at least buttons that are normally hardware even if they're sometimes soft) like Power, Menu, Home, Back, etc. For menu options and clicking on items on the screen I'd normally either bold them (or for long options like descriptions on tick boxes ""enclose them in quotes"". So for your example I'd say Settings -> About phone -> Android version Or Settings -> Display -> tick ""Auto-rotate screen"" Or giving a Xoom the ""three-fingered salute"" would be hold down Power + Volume Up at the same time."

2102,"Here is a set of general questions, gathered as very common questions asked every election. As mentioned in the instructions, the first two questions are guaranteed to show up in the Q&amp;A, while the others are if there aren't enough questions (or, if you like one enough, you may split it off as a separate answer for review within the community's 8).

1936,"The more appropriate close reason for the current and previous revision of the post might be ""primarily opinion based"". You could argue that one could collect statistics about which manufacturers upgrade the most often, and so on, but it's a rather complicated endeavor.  Within specific time periods and device lines you're going to find wildly different information, and none of it is useful going forward because there are simply no set-in-stone policies here.  We want questions to be useful to future readers without their answers needing to be revised all the time. Ultimately it still seems like a shopping advice question, or at least suffers from the same issues as those questions. I can't comment on the views of the other mods, but upon logging in today I found that all of them had viewed your post and declined to take action which is why I dismissed your flag."
703,Q: Is it possible to set a HTML signature in the Android Gmail app? (Nov 2011)

1588,"My opinion is that questions which are purely about gameplay (""How do I beat level 5 in Inexplicably Popular Social Game-of-the-Month?"") should go to Arqade. They simply aren't about Android the OS, even if the title is platform exclusive. Configuring hardware or something to work with a game could be OS dependent - something like ""How can I set up a Bluetooth controller for my Android device?"" as an example - and those seem okay, but gameplay questions should be directed to...well, gamers. We may have gamers here, but it's just not our purpose."
818,We definitely can't reproduce this. Did you try disabling any Chrome extensions you are using? Did you modify any of the default browser settings?
