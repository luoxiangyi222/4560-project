171,"I'm trying to add this to (regular, non-hosted) gmail. I haven't added a lot of widgets, and I'm stumped the gadget URL is  It shows up, but is empty  and the gadgets settings tells me I need to configure an ID (of course)... but I can't find a way to configure the ID.  Does this not work for gmail -- which otherwise accepts gadgets --, or can I configure it?"
620,"Case in point:  There are others, however. (This particular question is way too specific, asking about a bug release version on a particular device, but it should illustrate the point.) Anyway, what do we want to do with questions like this? There is no official ""changelog"" we can refer people to, except where there is a major revision. Even so, a change to just the third node in the version number is almost certainly nothing but bug fixes. Frankly, I think questions like this should be closed as ""too localized"", but I'm afraid we're going to keep getting them. Would it be worth it to have canonical questions for each of the major versions? We could add point-releases like this to the major version if we can suss out what was changed."
1549,"If you don't take any time to learn anything about the site you're visiting, it's not going to work for you.  Start here. We're not obligated to help you, and we are a community-led site.  Driveby comments that can be left by anyone are not in our best interest.  You will notice that you don't even need to sign up to post a question or answer, however. Without knowing what question you're referring to or what your comment would be, it's hard to help you further."
1682,"The +100 rep association bonus is not counted in the protection algorithm. The post notice states (emphasis added): To answer it, you must have earned at least 10 reputation on this site. and the ""on this site"" part is actually quite literal, though not entirely clear. Therefore, looking at your rep history, you've got +100 for the association bonus and +5 for an upvote on one of your questions. That nets you 5 rep from your activities on this site, which is still shy of the 10 needed. There is also a more detailed explanation of the ""protected"" status on Meta Stack Exchange, for reference. In this specific case, the view count of the question is pretty low, so I'm going to remove the protection. It looks like it was applied because it picked up a bunch of non-answers within the first 24 hours, but then the views petered off after that."
1051,"It is a question with a definite, non-subjective answer (as long as you just say what has changed and how, and stay away from saying if it's an actual improvement or now). However it's also very localized in time. The answer is only ever going to be useful for someone with your make/model and firmware version. The number of people with that combination is going to shrink to none over time as people pick up and apply the update. I think that this is probably something that would need to be taken on a question by question basis, and probably only for very major updates (eg 2.3 -> 4), or updates that would affect a lot of devices in the same way (eg a TouchWiz or Sense UI update)."
1193," Liam W answered:  I don't think there currently is anything about the way this site is run that I would change. I believe it is run fairly, and like all other SE sites - change is bad, after all.  Flow answered:  Hmm, every SX sites has some major issues if the site becomes big with a lot of questioners and only a few experienced people. I think the biggest problem right now on SO and maybe in the feature on AN.SX ist the quality of the questions. IMHO we need a better way to do some kind of QA .  Suraj Bajaj answered:  One thing I would want to change is requirement of 50 rep to add comments. It makes new users add comments as answers, which is ridiculous! I have seen a lot of posts like that on StackOverflow and a few on AE as well. And hence new users often gain too many down votes."
2187,"A duplicate answer is an answer that does not add any information not alerady in an older answer. Note that the above text is only an example, but you need to provide the link to the original answer, if you want quicker mod action and/or don't want mods to search for a possibly long time to find the original answer because they have to do other things too and you are uselessly delaying them with that. At the bottom of every answer, just above the comment section, there are at least these 3 buttons: ""share"", ""edit"" and ""flag"" (if this isn't there you couldn't flag in the first place.) Then, go to the duplicate answer and do step 5 (or 5.2, if you managed to keep the flag window open all that time). A duplicate answer is a duplicate, no matter when it is posted. It just needs to be posted at least 1 second later than the original one in order to be recognizable as a duplicate."
1559,"Your initial post was way to offensive. I am considering to delete it all together and taking additional measures, but first I want say a few words. There is absolutely no need to insult anyone. A user voted on some of your questions, so what? Nothing happened, and even if something had happened: Everything within the Stackexchange network can be reverted. Users need to read the questions and answers before they comment. This
  kind of closing of questions and answers just discourages involvement.
  The onus can't be on the submitter to explain why his stuff is
  different when the judge, jury, and executioner was simply too lazy to
  read. Why is it a problem to explain why you think your questions aren't duplicates, if somebody else doesn't think so? What's wrong with a discussion to find a consensus? Besides, nothing has happened, there was no 'executioner' involved."
435,"I wonder if we need these tags at all. People seem to be mostly using them to describe their devices, not to help categorize the question. That's the wrong use for them. Most of the time when I see tags like this or tags for devices, Android versions, or for a specific mod, the issue they're having has nothing to do with any of that. In fact, it makes things worse, because it will lead people to think that a solution that worked for someone's modded Galaxy S won't work for their unmodded Droid X and they'll ask a duplicate question. But that's beyond the scope of what we're discussing. I think ""unmodified"" should be the default position. I mean, unless someone specifies that they've used a mod, then it should be assumed they haven't. And, unless it's a problem that has been solved by a mod, there's no need to mention that the device in question is not modified. I suggest then that all three of the tags in question be removed. If there remain any questions where the unmodified state of the device is germane to the question, then ""unmodified"" makes a pretty unambiguous tag. Update: I've looked at a few of the stock-android and it's clear that we need to keep this tag or some variant. Many of the questions deal with returning a device to its unrooted, unmodified state. Some others are dealing with the standard Android UI (i.e., lacking HTC Sense, Moto BLUR, etc.). One of the latter, at least, I've tagged with stock-ui (and to which I will add a description post haste). So now I'm back-tracking on trying to eliminate the three tags originally brought up. When the question doesn't have anything to do with whether the phone is ""stock"" or not, they should still be removed. However, there are questions dealing with returning to ""stock"" or comparing the differences between ""stock"" and a mod or ""stock"" and manufacturer/carrier customizations. Those, I think, still need to have a tag of some sort. Perhaps questions about returning the device to its state before it came out of the box should be ""factory-setting"" or ""factory-state"". That should unambiguously cover returning a phone to its original state."
1129,I merged user into users and made the former a synonym of the latter. I'm going to leave user-accounts separate for now and we can revisit it later if needed.
