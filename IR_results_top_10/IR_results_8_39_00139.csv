1279,"Yes, search through all posts and replace deeplinks to wiki.cyanogenmod to point to oldwiki.cyanogenmod.org for the sake of a good user experience. And here's a local search (and another) or a custom Google search to find those posts. If you edit, be sure to let the link end in .org, because oldwiki.cyanogenmod.com is not available, only .org is."
1488,"From what I've seen of questions asked by developers having issue with the Play Store, most of the questions would be closed in any event, simply because (I'll see if I can dig up some examples, but it'll take time.) Further, would any of these questions have people who could answer them? We only have a few developers here; I expect most questions will remain neglected and unanswered. Granted, this last is a chicken-and-egg problem, but would developers come here and happily co-exist with Android users?  And what about the slippery-slope issue of, ""Well, you let me ask about Play Store Analytics for my app. Why won't you let me ask coding questions? All the developers are here anyway..."" I think, were we to change our policy, we'd end up with something like what we have with rooting/modding questions. Yes, we have a bunch, and some have good answers, but the really good information is elsewhere, and we're mostly just a gateway to that information. Only worse."
440,"I tend to agree. I haven't looked, but I'll wager that a good portion of those questions don't need the tag for the desktop OS anyway."
671,"Well, the title pretty much says it all, is it a good idea to create this in advance to reduce a flood of similar questions?"
29,"I think a lot of good points have already been made here but after taking a look at the existing questions, I really think people need to take a good hard look at this: Edit - I missed a few, and more just keep coming and coming... Guys, this is seriously awful.  We are just one day into the beta and out of 109 questions on the site, 22 of them (over 20%) are about which apps are ""good/bad/best"" - yikes! Worse, almost none of them are Community Wiki, so people are actually gaining rep for asking and answering the most mundane and subjective questions imaginable. I think this list very dramatically illustrates the problem with allowing these questions.  There's no end to them.  What's the best compass app?  What's the best flashlight app?  What's the best ukelele simulation app?  Gah! Is this what we're going to be, just a glorified review site?  Is it really that hard to just go to the market and read the reviews?  The Android developers have already built us this beautiful rating and review system that you can access right on your phone.  We don't need this fluff. Please, please, let's start closing these questions.  At the very least close them until we have moderators who can properly wikify them, but even then, I don't want to see people's 1-line recommendations taking up 20% of the site.  This is turning into a land grab with everybody wanting to own one of the big bad 500+ upvoted poll questions.  If we don't nip this in the bud, it's going to bite us hard later on. P.S. I'm not saying every question about an app is bad.  Here are two that are fine: In the first example, somebody is looking for a very specific app and has provided criteria to significantly narrow down the list of candidates.  In the second example, the author is asking for a comparison of two specific apps.  I see no problem with either of these. I just don't want to see two hundred ""Post your favourite [X] app"" polls by the time we hit public beta."
1401,One of the timer questions was miscategorized (I retagged it) and the others seemed to fall under the clock app as you've said.  Merged and synonymized! The breakdown of the other tags looks good to me.
2036,"I wouldn't say ""nothing relevant in common"" as Matthew put it (especially with MTK, which has its specifics). But what I agree with: This site is for end-users, and the majority of end-users probably has no clue whether their device features a mt6582 or rk3066 chip – and if they do, they can specify such in the question's text. A tag is not very useful if ignored by the majority even if it would fit – so I agree with Matthew we don't want/need those on an end-user site (it would look different if we were a techie-centric site, sure)."
765," Matthew Read answered: Get a second opinion, probably via the mod chatroom.  Multiple flags either means sock puppetry or something you just don't quite get.  Another set of eyes can help you catch the problem, rule it out, or investigate the abuse.  Al Everett answered: Depending on the situation, I'd leave a comment asking for more information; pop into Teacher's Lounge to ask for some other eyes to look it over; if it keeps happening check in to the users that are flagging it for potential sock-puppetry. But removing otherwise good content for no good reason doesn't seem right.  eldarerathis answered: I'd probably try to grab the other mods in chat and ask them to take a look. It's entirely possible that there's something I'm just missing, but it could be malicious flagging of some sort, too. If there's nobody readily available to take a look and the content truly doesn't appear ""low quality"" then I'd dismiss the flags and talk it out with other mods the next time they're available.  Bryan Denny answered: If it's salvageable, edit it to make it a more worth question. If it isn't ask the user to clarify and provide more info. If they don't, consult other mods and possibly close it. Really depends on the post.  Flow answered: I am not sure if this is possible, but I would try to contact and ask the flaggers for the reason of the “very low quality” flag. A second, third, ... mod opinion would also be helpful."
1665,"This is largely kind of a judgement call as to which flag you use on a given question. There's not a real hard and fast rule, but essentially: Many (honestly, probably most) dev questions asked here do not really fall into the migration category for one of a number of reasons. Often it is because the topic they're looking for help on is not actually covered on SO. Publishing questions are a good example of this - the best resource is Google's support channels, and SO usually closes questions related to publishing an app but not related to the actual programming. Similarly, questions that are of a low-to-mediocre quality are not migrated because the golden rule of migrations is: don't migrate crap. Quality here is a little nebulous, but it could be due to very poor formatting, not having enough information (e.g ""I get an error"" is not specific enough for SO) or questions that are overbroad (""How do I write a music app?"" is an example). Migrating a poor question is viewed as dumping more moderation work onto the receiving site, since they'll just end up closing it anyway. Also, if you're considering flagging a post for migration because it is of decent quality, then it's often a good idea to check the user's profile to see if they've already cross-posted it to SO. A lot of new-ish users seem to do this, and migrating a duplicate is not really useful, so these will generally just be closed here. A good rule of thumb, in my opinion: if in doubt, just pick the canned close reason. That at least gets the question into the review queue so that other people can get eyes on it as well. Plus, if someone else comes along and really thinks it should go to SO, they can still cast a migration vote even if that's not the flag you used."
