2427,"Done. Please go ahead and post your comment as an answer now. Thank you for asking here instead of taking the easy option by not posting an answer at all. If you're interested, this particular question was protected because of a flood of ""I have the same problem"" answers from new visitors."
2089,"I too think it is pretty much off-topic. Example 1: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one should I buy? We simply can't know the expectations and parameters of choice of any person. Example 2: I am stuck between Phone A and Phone B. Which one is
better? Since utility of a good is not quantifiable, the answers are going to be pretty much subjective and opinion-based. Example 3: I want a phone with following specs: blablabla Can you guys suggest any? There are websites that find phones with the desired specs already."
941,"I've earned both badges over on Stack Overflow, and they did not exist until after I had already exceeded the 3000 rep level and had VTC privileges. There are still a lot of other ways that flags are important, though, and which contribute to your helpful flag count: Also, if you come across a paticularly old post that you really think should be closed (but is unlikely to receive much traffic), I would consider flagging it with the ""Other"" reason after you have cast a close vote, then briefly explaining your reasoning. Although there are tools available to 10k+ members and mods that show recent close votes, it's easy to neglect them, whereas flags are very prominent. That's probably not going to get you into Deputy/Marshal territory with any kind of speed, though."
1051,"It is a question with a definite, non-subjective answer (as long as you just say what has changed and how, and stay away from saying if it's an actual improvement or now). However it's also very localized in time. The answer is only ever going to be useful for someone with your make/model and firmware version. The number of people with that combination is going to shrink to none over time as people pick up and apply the update. I think that this is probably something that would need to be taken on a question by question basis, and probably only for very major updates (eg 2.3 -> 4), or updates that would affect a lot of devices in the same way (eg a TouchWiz or Sense UI update)."
1534,"You ""asked"" that second question, and offered the solution as an answer. As that solution worked for you, you should accept that answer. If in the future another answer shows up which seems more suitable, you can still accept that (and thus un-accept yours). So I'd go ahead :)"
475,"Sure. There are plenty of great topics for blog posts that can hopefully go far above and beyond being a mere reference answer for common questions If this gets traction, coordinate with rebecca@stackexchange.com and she can get a provisional blog set up."
2024,"Stack Exchange is very community-focused, so don't worry that you can't personally verify an answer.  Other users will vote/comment as they see fit and any useful information should float to the top. If the question itself is localized to a particular situation that others won't encounter, or to software that is no longer available, etc. then the question should probably be closed.  You could flag it with a custom reason (explaining this) if that is the case. In the case of the specific question Firelord linked, the new answers don't seem very good so I have protected the question; however, it does seem like it will be relevant to future users so I'm not going to close it."
28,"I would certainly hope that model-specific questions are appropriate, otherwise we've rendered the entire site impotent as a support resource. However, your specific example question seems both speculative and not specific to Android, which probably isn't going to be considered on topic here."
622,"Frankly, I think questions like this should be closed as ""too localized"", but I'm afraid we're going to keep getting them. They're way too localized. Even a question like ""what's new in Android 4.0?"" would be marginal (I'd point them to Wikipedia, I look up what's new in each Google Chrome release on Wikipedia for example). An 2.3.x release on a specific phone model (I'm assuming vendors tweak each release?) is incredibly localized and trivial."
1311,"What circumstances is a general all-round ""yes you can"" or ""no you can't"" going to be useful? Are you just going to spend days throwing random commands at your tablet in random ways, or is there something specific that you're trying to do? What are you likely to be doing that has a chance of bricking your device? A question like ""Is there a chance rooting my device using the FancyNamed Rooting Method could brick my device?"" is answerable, (and will probably already be answered on the support thread for which ever rooting method you use). Your question as it is at the moment is very broad, has a lot of unknowns, and isn't really answerable with any answer that will stay the test of time."
