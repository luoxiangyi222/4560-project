460,"Maybe something like ""Only add a device or OS tag if your question is truly about your make and model, not just related!"" would be even clearer."
1795,"Building upon the ""EEE"" (Electronic Engineering Ethos) given by Dan: A place for Android Users from Android.SE, their friends, and their guests to talk about Android … and candies like JellyBeans, Kitkats … Depending on how long the string is allowed to be, we could explicitely add something like … Developers are welcome to listen Or even directly point them to the ""correct room""."
846,"As a new user i know i don't have something to say.
But personally i had never heard of this site before Android Guys wrote an article about your competition, and it was perfect because i had a question which i have looked for in the past month and haven't found any answers too. And suddenly i had a chance to both get a answer on my question and a chance to win a tablet. It was a win win for me, and since i made my user here, i have tried to help a couple of users, and i am pretty sure i will stick here for a good while, because i like the way the site is build and how it is working. So even though i'm a new user, and don't have anything to say, then you should know that the audio competition worked on me :) [off topic]BTW: how do you run this site, there aren't any commercials on the site. Where do you get the money to run the server and buy the prices in the competitions? [/off topic] "
1588,"My opinion is that questions which are purely about gameplay (""How do I beat level 5 in Inexplicably Popular Social Game-of-the-Month?"") should go to Arqade. They simply aren't about Android the OS, even if the title is platform exclusive. Configuring hardware or something to work with a game could be OS dependent - something like ""How can I set up a Bluetooth controller for my Android device?"" as an example - and those seem okay, but gameplay questions should be directed to...well, gamers. We may have gamers here, but it's just not our purpose."
615,"I think it makes a lot of sense to split these up sensibly, I'd propose something like this Do we really need an app-blocking tag? The one question that I think you're nominating for it, is really a PC question rather than an Android one (and quite an edge case even there) I'd think it would be better off on SuperUser than here, and even then I think ""locking"" is probably closer to what is happening than blocking (seems to be to do with locked handles on mounted drives/files).  *I'd think that call-blocking should be set to a synonym of call-screening (as surely blocking is just a type of screening where you don't allow the call through after screening it). One of the call-screening questions even mentions blocking in the title."
1390,"Thinking about this again, I don't know that a merge is really necessary here. I do think that remote-ussd-attack is a little verbose, and that ussd is sufficient (and can be paired with some other tag like security if needed. At the same time, since these are such incredibly low-traffic tags, a synonym probably won't even matter. So for now I've just done some retagging and left remote-ussd-attack to die on the vine. If, though some incredible turn of events, a synonym seems necessary later on then we'll cross that bridge."
1423,"I like the suggestion. And it's even better if we have a volunteer. :) If there are no objections and counter arguments, then the separation should get done."
1565,"It depends a little. IMHO it is clearly on-topic as long as it is user-oriented (and not development-oriented), even it might be a ""power-user's terrain"". And even more on-topic if it's clearly something Android specific (as you've already indicated, many commands are ""a little different"", e.g. not all options are available to them). But as you've asked for ""the best site"", there's also a second point to consider: If it's a generic quesion on available commands, or how to deal with things like redirecting output, piping, listing directories etc., that might fit better on either Unix &amp; Linux or Super User (at least you should check the questions there before, as you might find yours already answered)."
422,Looks like Twitter is broken - even their own tweet button builder won't work with text that contains a quote.  
526,"I'll never use +1, just like I never use StumbleUpon or the Facebook ""likes"".  That said, other people will.  I see no reason not too, really.  Even if it dies in the future, it's probably not much work to integrate it (the SE people or Al can correct me on this if I'm wrong)."
