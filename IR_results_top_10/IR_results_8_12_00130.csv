389,"Now that we have Android Web Market, do we still need QR? PS: should this be a separate question?"
419,"Since we're focused on Android, not iDevices, I don't think we need to be as ""strict"" about being very specific about devices or the distinction between hardware and OS. I think the only tags we need are iphone and maybe ios. If the type of device is really that important to the question, then it seems to me that the question is probably off-topic. By the by, some of the questions you're running into were migrated from the defunct gadgets.stackexchange.com. Android and iPhone were both on topic. Not sure if we should bother resurrecting those."
1803,"I'm terrible at naming things like this, but a lot of the other chat rooms use amusing names to try to mix things up. One that popped into my head was something like: The Candy Shop A chat room for Android users to discuss devices, apps, the latest Android news and gossip, and how many warranties they've voided. Something that plays with the idea of Android releases being named after deserts and such. The description is intended to be a little more friendly but also informational. We probably do need to be conscious of the fact that the room listings only get you 40-50 characters before they truncate (you can see the full description by viewing the room info, though). Therefore, keeping the word ""users"" (or something like that) near the front of the description might be a good idea. Also, by not calling it ""Android"" we might help prevent people with programming questions from getting sucked in."
2318,"Development related questions are always flagged as &quot;Off topic&quot; in AE. Either you are developing &quot;for&quot; Android or &quot;on&quot; Android, it's a question referring some &quot;Development&quot;. Just took an example: You can install compilers in Android devices. Lets assume you need to compile a program written in any language (commonly it's a development process).
You can build using your Android device, but what if it didn't compile properly? You can not ask those compilation issues in any of the Android platform forums, because its not related to &quot;Operating system&quot;  which you use to build your program. Its purely coding related issue. Better to be posted in coding forums. Similarly here &quot;It doesn't matter you build it 'for' or 'on' Android&quot;, OP tries to compile an app, so needs to be flagged as Off topic."
1821,"I agree that we need clearer description about our chat room. Currently, it doesn't really tell anything, including the misunderstanding between general topic and programming-related (also, as seen on the main site...). The least we can do is to make them notice before they enter the room, which is the job for chat room's description. As for the name, actually I don't really have an issue with it. Of course, unique and memorable name is better if possible. My idea is more-or-less like this: Droid Lover A place to have general discussion about Android. If you have a problem related to Android app development, please go to Stack Overflow or its chat. Finally, relax, and enjoy the sweets! (feedback and corrections are really appreciated since I'm not a native speaker)"
1049,"I don't know, whereas screen and display were really just different ways of saying the same thing,and were proper synonyms. These all seem like specific cases where a specific aspect or behaviour is being asked about. I think people are likely to search for ""screen timeout"" or ""screen brightness"" so these are useful tags. Though as the one question in Screensaver makes clear, that whole idea just doesn't make sense in Android at the moment, so it's debatable whether we need that tag at all. But if things like Android x86 take off and we start seeing Android in more devices like desktop-style machines, or when Android is running devices with expensive screens that are permanently connected to the mains power, like TVs, set top boxes and Ouyas then screensavers could become a real thing for Android in the future."
2007,"My question is related to Doze Mode, a feature in the Android 6.0 Preview 3 which will be released at the end of this month. My question has been marked [On Hold] but I think it may be important for some people who need to prepare their software for the new version of Android which break some things may be important (it is for me). Why was my question placed on hold?"
672,"When will my device get the Android 4.0 update (Ice Cream Sandwich)? I need a link to the official announcement, and a link to the updated Google Compatibility Guidelines would be useful, if someone wants to track that down."
155,"Al E.'s great idea just needs a little setting up for those that would miss the reference. Something like: ""Android Questions? These are the Answers you are looking for."" (No comments under 50 rep is a PITA! Sorry for the additional answer)"
435,"I wonder if we need these tags at all. People seem to be mostly using them to describe their devices, not to help categorize the question. That's the wrong use for them. Most of the time when I see tags like this or tags for devices, Android versions, or for a specific mod, the issue they're having has nothing to do with any of that. In fact, it makes things worse, because it will lead people to think that a solution that worked for someone's modded Galaxy S won't work for their unmodded Droid X and they'll ask a duplicate question. But that's beyond the scope of what we're discussing. I think ""unmodified"" should be the default position. I mean, unless someone specifies that they've used a mod, then it should be assumed they haven't. And, unless it's a problem that has been solved by a mod, there's no need to mention that the device in question is not modified. I suggest then that all three of the tags in question be removed. If there remain any questions where the unmodified state of the device is germane to the question, then ""unmodified"" makes a pretty unambiguous tag. Update: I've looked at a few of the stock-android and it's clear that we need to keep this tag or some variant. Many of the questions deal with returning a device to its unrooted, unmodified state. Some others are dealing with the standard Android UI (i.e., lacking HTC Sense, Moto BLUR, etc.). One of the latter, at least, I've tagged with stock-ui (and to which I will add a description post haste). So now I'm back-tracking on trying to eliminate the three tags originally brought up. When the question doesn't have anything to do with whether the phone is ""stock"" or not, they should still be removed. However, there are questions dealing with returning to ""stock"" or comparing the differences between ""stock"" and a mod or ""stock"" and manufacturer/carrier customizations. Those, I think, still need to have a tag of some sort. Perhaps questions about returning the device to its state before it came out of the box should be ""factory-setting"" or ""factory-state"". That should unambiguously cover returning a phone to its original state."
