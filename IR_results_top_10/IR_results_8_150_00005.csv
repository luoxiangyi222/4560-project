2339,"I agree with the sentiment here, that if someone obviously is being unethical, then the question should be closed. BUT, then the other side of me says, this is all computer science, right? The information that you share to help me hack an app illegally may help someone else tremendously in another way. It's like if I'm a gunshop. A person comes in and wants his gun fixed. I don't give him a form and grill him to make sure he won't shoot anybody in order for me to fix it. I fix it, and if I have suspicion that he's acting illegally I will notify the police. He may be an honest hunter. But if I refuse to fix the gun, or tell him what he needs to fix it, he will go away disappointed and without a solution.
So, I'm not sure that we should be really suspicious of possibly unethical questions. Provide the information, and it's up to the person to be ethical with it."
2087,"Be specific If you ask a vague question, youâ€™ll get a vague answer. But if you give us details and context, we can provide a useful answer. I find this not precise. What details are we expecting from them? At least we should give them a hint as an example, either on same page or with links pointing to high quality questions or templates demonstrating what kind of minimum or recommended amount of information a question should have. There are users (like me) who doesn't pick up easily or do not understand what to pick up if you don't give them examples or even hints. That guideline lacks that crucial info. Following are the solutions scattered across this site or on other sites that I picked up: Unlike other sites, for first time users, this is what Stack Overflow shows to them (a mandatory read):  I don't think it would help us at all, given that Stack Overflow itself is far from solving the problem of unclear and low-quality question even after having this solution for years. Supplementary readings: Forget about readings, we have this approach discussed here: When asking a question, enforce user to read the FAQ first, and the most upvoted answer (from a moderator) notes: It won't work. Like we all do with EULAs, they'll tick the box without reading and keep going. If there's any fanciness like a timer or making sure they scroll the page, they'll just cheat it and still not read it. (Emphasis mine) It is interesting to note that the author of that answer was in favor of that solution when it was implemented long time ago on Stack Overflow. :D I personally too do not find this approach much useful for the same reason. The recently asked question Adding a template question to the Ask Question box seeks input on that regard. It has not received any counter argument as an answer, but neither a helpful answer that sketches out what needs to be there in a template. I find this approaching appealing simply because I couldn't find a way to confirm that it has no merit or less merit relative to other approaches. At first read, it appears to be useful since it can at least acknowledge  the poster the need to mention Android version, Device name, rooting status, among other things we need to sketch out. Note that it is not fine for us to seek such crucial details since posting a comment for such clarification is quite a waste of our time. Don't you agree? But since the given circumstances doesn't give any excuse to us, we're left with one option: to invest/waste our time on something which should've been there at first place. Like every other approach, there is no guarantee that it would work or significantly bring down the amount of time we end up wasting on such questions, but our aim should always be to do the best we can to solve the problem. We may not be able to eliminate it but we shouldn't just live with it either, unless all feasible solutions are considered. Forget it please! It has not stopped the wrath of NAA we receive, so better not be considered for implementation IMO. Note: You need to do some work now!"
2099,"Answers don't determine whether questions are duplicates. If an answer needs updating or another needs to be posted you should do one or all of: However, I'm pretty sure you're not correct about all of those changes since 5.0, since I was able to find and add methods that definitely work on some 5.1 and 6.0 devices.  Try it out. You should also look at my second answer.  This is not supposed to be possible for you to bypass, especially not with a locked bootloader.  That's the entire point of the feature."
1136,"I agree that they don't need to be distinct.  I've merged them into networking.  A synonym wouldn't work since ""network access"" is a subset of ""networking""."
1326,"The thing with ""too minor"" edits is a good point. AFAIK the background of this restriction is to prevent &lt;2000 rep users from gaming the system by making a lot of small and easy edits that don't completely fix a post. Edits should fix all issues of a post. Not just the minor ones. But if there were only minor ones that needed to be fixed and got fixed with the suggested edit then I tend to approve the edit."
2038,"If the changes to be made are so minor that you can't find anything else to change, then just move on. In my experience, there is rarely a post that needs edits where there is not more than six characters to fix. Even so, there are plenty of other posts that are in serious need of editing. Once you get to 2000 reputation you won't have to worry about it."
1717,"I think this kind of question is very close to others we've had about enterprise-style deployment of Android devices in businesses and schools. We don't have the right kind of users on the site to give good answers yet, but if we keep getting these questions, the experts will find us soon enough."
1241,"It's a problem all over, not just here. Not five minutes ago I voted to close a programming question on Web Applications. And how about all of the ""how do I fix this non-programming Android issue"" questions that have been closed on Stack Overflow? (And believe me, there have been a lot more of them than development questions here.) There are any number of helpful hints to guide potential Askers to the right place. You probably don't remember because you've been around for a while, but there's a dialog that new users need to click through before posting that says basically: I have read what this site is about, I see it again here right in front of me, and this is the right place, so let me ask my question. There's the FAQ, of course. And the ""Ask Question"" page does give guidance, at least until your reputation meets a certain threshold. The problem, and it's not limited to here, is that people don't read on the Web. The only thing that keeps sites on topic is swift, efficient, ruthless moderation when people post off-topic stuff. (Remember Usenet?) That's because people will post off-topic stuff; it can't be stopped. Don't forget, we also have the development tag, which has been left on here as kind of a ""honeypot"" to make it easier to find off-topic questions. (The assumption being, of course, that anyone doing development would see that tag and use it, in spite of the tag wiki excerpt explicitly saying that such questions are off-topic.) Unfortunately, the applications tag (which is terribly misused and abused and is in dire need of cleanup) is almost always one of the sample tags suggested and, since they're developing an application, must be the tag they want, right? So, yes, it's annoying and I wish these people would get a clue. Don't worry about the Moderators' time, though. We don't need to waste it with simple stuff like this. Just continue to vote to close. Downvote them for wasting your time. (Enough downvotes&mdash;six, I believe&mdash;and the question drops off the front page.) If you're feeling kind, point them to the FAQ. But you should probably resign yourself to the fact that no matter how many clues and help and speed bumps we put in front of new users (and there are quite a few), some people are going to post off-topic stuff. All we can hope to do is educate them, hopefully educate people who see their off-topic question and so won't repeat the mistake, and close them down without mercy."
347,"It's generally sufficient to link to the other question and explain why it doesn't meet your needs. All we're looking for is some kind of evidence that the question asker put some effort into it, and this clearly meets that bar."
1186,"If you edit again it will overwrite your first suggestion, as long as that suggestion has not already been approved or rejected. As for Izzy's comment: Hit the ""Improve"" button.  This will allow you to fix up the post to contain all the fixes (use ""view source"" in the edit history if needed) and there is a checkbox for whether the suggested edit was helpful in the improvement effort or not."
