If there's any fanciness like a timer or making sure they scroll the page, they'll just cheat it and still not read it. There are already lots of pointers to the FAQ and asking guidelines when you post here for the first time.  (Log out and take a look!)  We can do our best to make sure that content is available and helpful, but we can't do anything about the users who refuse to make use of it. See also: Add &quot;I have read the FAQ&quot; check box to the Ask Question page among many others."
1930,"Coming late to this one, as I was just thinking about the same (and found this by a ""search-before-ask""): there are actually 3 tags here going very close together. Though at a first glance it looks like they all could be merged-and-synonymed, we should not do so â€“ as all 3 of them have their dedicated purpose: However, these tags should be used in XOR manner: I see no need for any combination (except for making them easier to find, maybe ;)"
72,"Pulling this out of comments so it can receive proper votes, if it's the way to go:  [version-codename] 2.1-Eclair 2.2-Froyo This avoids the overly-verbose ""android"" in the tag, and it makes the tag findable with the auto-complete if you start typing either the version number or the codename."

1329,I'd like to hear other opinions too but my stance is that it's ok. Especially since you are an (active) member of the site and sure going to watch the ankidroid tag.  I'd like to make it clear that it's was 100% correct to ask first. Android Enthusiasts should not become a support/discussion forum for the various Android Apps out there if they Apps have a dedicated forum or help site. The question that remains is: Does AE.SX become a second place for Ankidroid support or are you going to close/archive the Google Group?
456,"Given Jeff's answer &amp; response to my comment, and the fact that I can't see that any of our tag wikis currently ""Provide basic guidance on when to use the tag"" (though they do define what the tag means), I'd suggest we start with this. The Device/OS tags are a great example - can we first define when it is appropriate/useful to apply these tags, add some guidance to the tag wikis and see if that makes any difference?"
73,"Wow, my first tumbleweed badge.  Wohoo! I guess I'm going with ""Not a question"""
666,"Not sure about smartphones. But there is also tablet, so maybe it makes sense to keep the smartphone tag also. I am in favor of blacklisting mobile-phones and cellphones. Matthew is right: If the phone functionality in question is calling, calls is the tag to go. And for everything else, mobile-phones and cellphones is to broad and inaccurate."
860,This if fine by me. Martin covers all the points I was going to say. Pass on over the good questions. :)
303,"I don't think that question is a shopping recommendation or off topic.  He is not asking if he should buy a phone or a particular plan.  He's asking if a phone can reasonably be used without using more than 150 MB of data per month and to provide context he has mentioned that this is the criteria that he's using to decide whether or not to buy a particular phone/data plan. He could have phrased it like this:  Is it possible for a phone to be used regularly and not go over 150 MB
  of data in a month I realize that I could just turn the
  phone off and it wouldn't use any data
  but is it possible to use a phone on a
  regular basis and stay under 150 MB
  per month or is the fact that the
  phone is on and doing background syncs
  going to use more than that much data? ... at it's core this question is asking the same thing as the one I mentioned above.  It clearly wouldn't be a shopping recommendation. Here's another way it could have been phrased: Should I get a 150 MB per month or and unlimited data plan? I'm looking for a phone to make phone
  calls, text and light internet use. 
  Should I get the Unlimiated data or
  would I be fine getting the metered
  plan? This is a shopping recommendation.  The questions are very similar but I think that at it's core this question is distinctly different.  The second one is asking the community to make decision for him and tell him what to purchase.  The question in question here was not asking us to make a decision for him, it was asking whether a certain theorized use was practical and/or possible because he felt that it was an important criteria in making his own decision. While I think that phrasing is important, I think we can use a little discretion to determine what the heart of the question is and not require that question askers contort their questions to follow a strict phrasing criteria, simply to avoid using words that are related to off-topic questions. To summarize:"
