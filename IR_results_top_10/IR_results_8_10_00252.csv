1714,"for that moderator to unilaterally delete the question in order to prevent further discussion of their decision Discussion of whether to close or delete a question shouldn't be taking place on that question.  It should be taking place on the appropriate meta site.  Such meta discussions can still take place with the question being deleted. You posted a meta question, and looking at that meta question there is certainly no clear community consensus that the question should be reopened/undeleted.  Were there to have been a clear community opinion that the closure wasn't correct, you should have seen the question be undeleted and reopened."
2007,"My question is related to Doze Mode, a feature in the Android 6.0 Preview 3 which will be released at the end of this month. My question has been marked [On Hold] but I think it may be important for some people who need to prepare their software for the new version of Android which break some things may be important (it is for me). Why was my question placed on hold?"

985,"I do agree that a little improvement needs to be performed on some of the lightest grey's used. I mainly use Firefox 13.0.1 under Ubuntu 12.04, and with my recently acquired ASUS VE228 LED Monitor, I have some trouble recognizing some of the lightest grey colors currently being used. Using Firebug, I've analyzed and collected some information regarding tags or classes that apply a light grey as a background color for a visual representation: #F4F4F4 is hard to see .post-tag class currently using #F4F4F4 This class is used on on regular tags. e.g., hard-to-see #F3F3F3 is hard to see code tag currently using #F3F3F3  This tag is used on inline code, when we wrap something around a `. e.g., I'm inline highlighted code pre tag currently using #F3F3F3 This tag is used when we either press ctrl + k or use the toolbar button . e.g., #F6F6F6 is hard to see, with considerations .owner class currently using #F6F6F6 This class is used for the background of a users signature. Note:
Since the rectangle for a user signature has a respectable size, it's easier to notice the color difference between the white background and the signature background. #EEEEEE works very well blockquote tag currently using #EEEEEE This tag is used when we either press ctrl + q or use the toolbar button . e.g., I'm a quote block In order to properly understand if this was an issue of my newly acquired monitor, or a overall situation, I've performed some tests (opening and navigating the  page) using difference OSâ€™s and monitors. Here's the conclusions: Windows XP Professional Version 2002 SP3 | ASUS VE228 LED Monitor Browsers used: Result obtained: equal results on all browsers My conclusion for the tests performed is that under optimal color calibration conditions, the light grey's used are hard to distinguish from the white background. It gets really hard when we're reading a paragraph with some inline code, because at first glance I can't spot it. The code-block fails only if we are reading a single line of code. When two or more lines are used, it is reasonable visible, just like the background color for the user signature. Windows 7 Home Edition SP1 | Toshiba Laptop - Satellite C660 (built-in monitor) Browsers used: Result obtained: equal results on all browsers My Toshiba doesn't have any color calibration applied, since I don't perform any graphical design with it. The sole purpose for this laptop is the test of work being developed, just like a client would see it, so, everything is by default across the system. Here, It appears to work well on all browsers on all colors tested. Naturally that the light grey is more like a blueish color than actually a tone from black-to-white. So I can't really rely on this as to a positive assessment, I'll consider it a false-positive. Every grey color currently used below the tone provided by #EEEEEE can't stand out if used on small areas. Some improvements are noted if used of considerably large areas. The #EEEEEE works well for calibrated an non calibrated working environments. Have the following colors updated to a slightly dark tone: This assessment was performed with a Linux tool called Agave. I've used the tool color piker and picked the colors from examples provided on this answer. Then, I've lowered the tone by one, and the result provided was far more visible then the one picked.  HTML color code is placed on the lower right side of the color rectangle Using Agave color picker on this image, I did get the correct code for each rectangle picked. There seems to be no distinction between the colors in use or proposed colors when placed side by side respectively. All three used colors side by side are visually equal. Same goes for the ones suggested. As a side note: one may consider using just one color to replace the three being used."
1419,"As there (currently) is no way to ""categorize"" related tags, it might also be a good idea to sum them up in the ""most generic"" tag of the group to make them easier to find. For example, the security is such a ""quite generic"" tag. So its tag-wiki could contain a list of related tags such as '2-step-verification', 'malware', 'antivirus', 'lost-phone', and the like. Having such a list in a ""single place"" (i.e. the ""declared master-tag"") makes them easier to manage as well: other places (e.g. other tag-wikis) could simply refer to that place (""for other related tags, also see..."") -- and the ""related-list"" would only need to be maintained once."
517,I do not know the ins-and-outs of the automated quality filters that are in place. I suspect that the lack of capital letters might be one of the triggers. You don't mention the title you were trying to use; if it was identical to your question text that would be an easy filter to put into place. You would do well to try some of the suggestions in the answers to the two questions eldarerathis linked to.
2232,"I don't know if there is general SE guidance on this, but I would say yes &mdash; clear cut cases seem like a good place for flags.  This site is not at the point where moderators need to heavily triage flags, as yet.  That said, I also go fully through most queues regularly, so a flag is not strictly necessary."
778,"It looked like service was actually mostly used to refer to network issues, i.e., problems with ""phone service"".  I replaced it with connectivity in most places, services where applicable.  I think it's probably best to let service die out rather than merge with something else.  If it comes up again we should probably rename it to phone-service or something clearer."
264,"I definitely see now why it makes sense not to do this kind of tagging -- clicking the tag will show you all the questions where the user has Device X, when you really want to see all the questions about Device X. That said, many questions need device and OS info, and the tags are a convenient place to put it, for consistency reasons.  The information is always in the same place and clearly distinct from the question, so the potential answerer doesn't have to search the question for it (or remember it all as they read the question). I think the optimal solution would be to have separate fields for device and OS version that the asker could fill in if it's relevant.  The info could be shown in a separate box or something at the end of the question.  I'm not sure how much work this would be for the SE people or if it's desirable to modify this site / some sites this way, since it's clearly not applicable across the board.  Perhaps instead the FAQ could show a standard template that people should insert at the end of their question, something like:"
