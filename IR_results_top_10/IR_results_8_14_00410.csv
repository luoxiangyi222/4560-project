1382,"This is actually a result of a different scenario, but from the front page it's effectively indistinguishable from a normal Community♦ bump. What actually happened here was: In this situation, Community♦ (evidently) becomes the ""owner"" of the last modification to the post since it would otherwise end up being attributed to a non-existent account. In fact, clicking on the timestamp for the last activity on the front page will link you directly to the deleted answer."
2355,"I had been an active reviewer of all queues including the First Posts, and I currently top the First Posts review stats at 5436 posts reviewed. In the past I always clear the queue (or use up the daily 20 limit), but starting last month I personally no longer visit the First Posts queue. 3 reasons:"
1660,"Somehow I was on the 'active bounty' thing.  ""There are no questions with an active bounty at the moment.
Perhaps you'd like to select a different tab?"" Should the URL give some clue?"
1828,"If you meant by this,  It actually shows the last activity on that post, excluding the deletion. Most possibly, here is the actual timeline: Hence, it shows Darshak Parikh's answer as the last activity."
513,"To add to what Michael P. said: if you're really interested in a particular user's activity you can always subscribe to his/her user rss feed. The link is found on the user profile page, in the lower right corner."

1701,"There could be a couple of reasons for this. If you have a specific question in mind that you'd like an explanation for then feel free to point it out and I (or someone else) can take a look, but off the top of my head a few possibilities would be: If the question's last activity is attributed to Community♦ and there are no edits/modifications, then it's often (but not necessarily always) because Community♦ will periodically bump old unanswered questions to the front page, to give them additional visibility. I don't know if this is really explained anywhere, but the profile description for Community♦ does note this. If a question is reopened, it will get bumped to the front page, but there isn't any immediately obvious activity on it. You can see the close/reopen activities in the post's revision history, though. It's possible that someone posted a comment, spam, or other non-answer as an answer, which was then subsequently deleted. You'll still see the activity on the front page of the site, but you won't be able to see the deleted post without 10k reputation, so it will seem like some kind of phantom activity took place. If the account is a spam account, then it may be destroyed, which will attribute the activity (on the front page) to Community♦ instead of the original poster. I may be missing some other situations here as well, but I would say that these are the most common on our site."
895,"From what I've seen this site gets more than its fair share of drive-by readers. So, without even a modicum of reputation points they're not doing any voting. I've not been as active as I would like (for other reasons) but when I am active I try to use up my votes every day. There's often not enough things to vote on, though."
40,"[beta] : Actively participated in the private beta. If I recall correctly from the Web Applications stackexchange beta, these are awarded just a bit after the site goes public beta, once you have actively participated. This site has been running nye on 3 days. It's far, far to early for the beta badge to be awarded."
