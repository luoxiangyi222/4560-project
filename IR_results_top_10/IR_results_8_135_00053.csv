2095,"I agree with Al's point. Of course the natural mechanism of the system takes care of such bad/strange answers. However, in some cases, it can be hard giving a very specific answer, thus resorting to using  ""I think..."" or ""Your best bet probably is..."" or ""I haven't tried this app so I don't know but..."" ""I think"" at this point, ""your best bet probably is"" that not everything that works on my phone will work for someone else's phone. Android is Android, yet there are so many caveats, that make giving certain answers sometimes hard to do in different situations. Until one has had the opportunity to use over the 10,000 different types of devices that exist today, I doubt anyone can give 100% certain answers on everything. For instance, in answering this question, I used the expression, ""could"", pointing out that, I'm not certain. Although TWRP saved my life some time ago on my Z2, does not necessarily mean it will work for this OP. I wasn't certain it will work, not because I don't know what I was saying, but because what works for me is different from what will work for someone else. Of course, outright nonsense answers need to be flagged, yet, the idea of suggestions aren't all bad, as what works for me won't work for my friend next door, always! TL;DR Not knowing an answer to a question is different from not being certain something'll work for the OP. Thus, I don't think the use of ... ""I think..."" or ""Your best bet probably is..."" or ""I haven't tried this app so I don't know but..."" ... is entirely a bad thing."
1531,"Usually questions that could fill a whole book as answer are closed as ""too broad"" on all sites within the SX network. I can't comment on why this hasn't happened on the Security SX example question you gave. The have the same policy about ""too broad"" as any other site. But as eldarathis pointed out, the two questions are not on the same level regarding broadness. QA sites like Android Enthusiasts work best if you have a specific problem. And no, wanting to know how Android works is not a specific problem."
1000,"Answer it, it is almost certain that you're not the only person experiencing the issue, and other people might have the same problem that will be helped by knowing that the issue is fixed in the newer version, that will convince them to update or at least they may be able to find a workaround after knowing the nature of the problem. Make sure to include the version info of the buggy software and the version that fixed the problem."
2363,"This site isn't a forum. There aren't ""follow-ups"" here: there are questions and answers. If you want to ask a question, use the Ask question button. If you know the answer to a question, write it in Your answer under that question. It doesn't matter how relevant it is: if it's not an answer to the question, it doesn't belong there. People who know the answer to your question won't see it if it's not posted as a question, and they can't help you, because you can't answer an answer. Running the site in this format is what makes it a repository of information that's easy to find and navigate, without the problems of thread hijacking and ""me too"" posts that you get on a forum. It means that people who know about the thing you're asking about will see your question on the front page of the site: you're not relying on them looking on the n-th page of a thread about a related question that they're not going to look at because they already know the answer. The tour is a really brief introduction to all of this. You get a badge for reading it, but more importantly, you also learn how to get your questions answered by experts."
399,"My part in that conversation started because travis said that his phone had the same problem as the OP's, so at first I was trying to find a common thread between their two devices. If they were both running ROMs running Sense UI that would suggest that perhaps it wasn't necessarily a hardware-specific issue and those of us trying to help should focus more on their particular firmwares and not just the phones themselves.  When travis said he didn't know I wanted to try to be clear when explaining to him what he needed to know in order to give me a useful answer. I hope that clarifies my seemingly off-topic comments.  :)"
846,"As a new user i know i don't have something to say.
But personally i had never heard of this site before Android Guys wrote an article about your competition, and it was perfect because i had a question which i have looked for in the past month and haven't found any answers too. And suddenly i had a chance to both get a answer on my question and a chance to win a tablet. It was a win win for me, and since i made my user here, i have tried to help a couple of users, and i am pretty sure i will stick here for a good while, because i like the way the site is build and how it is working. So even though i'm a new user, and don't have anything to say, then you should know that the audio competition worked on me :) [off topic]BTW: how do you run this site, there aren't any commercials on the site. Where do you get the money to run the server and buy the prices in the competitions? [/off topic] "
527,"Since the more a site or page gets +1 clicks the higher it appears in Google's search results Er.. this isn't true, and if it was there would be, as Robocop once said, ""problems"". These +1s are intimately tied to Social Search, that is, if Google knows who you are and your friend network, those results might be escalated for you only: "
1730,"I think most savvy users already know better than to run software that's only available as a download from a file-sharing site such as Mediafire, so TBH I wouldn't include such a link at all. If you have to link to an official ROM, then link to the source on the manufacturer's site or equivalent. If you have to link to some other software, link to the distributor's website, or to the relevant XDA Developers page. That has several advantages.  Users can have some confidence about what software they're downloading, and whether it's been tampered with or contains malware On a site like XDA Developers, people discuss the software in question, so visitors can find out more information, and whether the software can be relied on, by looking at other people's comments there. If the distribution method of the software changes, the original page will update their links, so visitors can still get the file without anything on this site having to change. The idea of avoiding link-only answers isn't only to avoid broken links: that reason's quoted most because it's easier to understand. The other reason is that a link-only answer doesn't tell the user what to expect at the other end. Linking to some random file on Mediafire has just the same problem: I don't know whether I'm getting genuine, working software, or a trojan. Linking to an official source or another reputable site lets me know what to expect, making your answer more useful to everyone."
365,"I'm not entirely sure how the tag wiki privileges work, to be honest, but based on the rep listings (for a beta site): Technically speaking, then, it appears that 1500 rep is not actually enough to edit wikis without approval. This does seem a bit confusing, though, since you could seemingly approve your own edit based on the by-the-letter description of the 1500 rep priv. I don't know if it actually works out that way, though..."
2457,"Thanks a lot Dan for your work as a Moderator and as a learned and a trusted user of this site. While I find your answers truly insightful and inspiring (one of those answers which actually inspired me to start contributing to this site), I equally appreciate your work as a Moderator.  I was one of the candidates running up for elections back in 2016, and while I lost and kind of felt bad because I lost to you (a momentary emotion, usual to mortals; and Izzy was sure to win anyway, so I was competing with you mostly :D), I gradually realized that the community chose a much better person as a Moderator than what I could be back than.  You brought to the table the kind of patience as a Moderator I didn't know  in person. (I think I failed to witness that in other Mods before 2016 was mostly because earlier the Mods were understaffed and under heavy janitorial work load so exercising that much patience might have been detrimental to the site, so they did what they thought was best for the site which I appreciate equally).  You started salvaging those borderline developer-cum-end-user oriented questions which I et al hastily thought would be closed as off-topic. One of the distinct trait I noted was that you often let the community decide what to do with questions which introduced ambiguity when deciding the scope of the concerned questions.  Furthermore, unless somebody else responded first, you (Izzy too) always remained in site's room, welcomed the visitors as a host and guided them gently. My personal interaction with you further strengthened my respect for you as a Moderator, especially when I brought to Mods' concern issues which were somewhat unhealthy to the community, and which sometimes I brought with emotions leading to indiscreet engagement. But, you always exercised that basic trait of a Moderator to remain cool, see the facts as it is, and never misuse or abuse the power no matter if it solves the problem in the short run.   I'm not good with memory so that's what I could recall. That been said, thank you again Dan for helping us fellow users, along with our other hard working Moderators, to focus on that which matters most to us (asking quality questions and answering insightful answers)"
