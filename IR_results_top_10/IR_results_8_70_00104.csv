822,"I normally save the &lt; kbd > tags for actual hardware buttons (or at least buttons that are normally hardware even if they're sometimes soft) like Power, Menu, Home, Back, etc. For menu options and clicking on items on the screen I'd normally either bold them (or for long options like descriptions on tick boxes ""enclose them in quotes"". So for your example I'd say Settings -> About phone -> Android version Or Settings -> Display -> tick ""Auto-rotate screen"" Or giving a Xoom the ""three-fingered salute"" would be hold down Power + Volume Up at the same time."
1654,"From your screenshot, it looks like you've hit the font selection problem with the Roboto font. If you install Roboto under Linux, then when a site or program asks for Roboto, it gets ""Roboto Medium"" (which is quite heavyweight) instead of ""Roboto Regular"" (which looks normal). This is a problem with how the weights are set in the font files. This site has an explanation of how to change your font configuration to avoid the problem. Once you've added the workaround you'll notice that ASE looks a lot 'lighter' in font terms, and much easier on the eye."
913,"You know, I actually think I tried to suggest this a few weeks back but I didn't meet the criteria for suggesting the synonym at the time (and then forgot about it). In any case, agreed and done."
1387,"I say no. ""Unknown sources"" is (should be) about the setting. ""Sideloading"" is (should be) about the act of installing an app outside of the context of the Market/Play Store/etc. They are related, sure, but I don't think they're the same."
2214,"Actually, though the animation is done by an event listener (as Matthew pointed out), there's no userscript needed. You can easily fool the javascript part by setting the animation duration to 0s in CSS: That did it for me at least."
737,"It would be more accurate to say ""None that I know of"", because there can perfectly be one, including a private one. Also Stackexchange aims at being a knowledge base, with long term questions and long term valid answers. A ""No"" or ""Not at this time"" is not a long term answer. But actually the question itself is poorly written. It should be ""What application does ..."", having no answer until such an application exists."
557,"We shouldcan only create tags when there are posts to put them against. For one thing, no one may actually ask a question about that device. For another, the Stack Exchange software removes tags that don't have any questions associated with them after some number of days. (Four, I think.) So even if we didcould set up tags ahead of time it's likely they'd get deleted before someone used them."
1051,"It is a question with a definite, non-subjective answer (as long as you just say what has changed and how, and stay away from saying if it's an actual improvement or now). However it's also very localized in time. The answer is only ever going to be useful for someone with your make/model and firmware version. The number of people with that combination is going to shrink to none over time as people pick up and apply the update. I think that this is probably something that would need to be taken on a question by question basis, and probably only for very major updates (eg 2.3 -> 4), or updates that would affect a lot of devices in the same way (eg a TouchWiz or Sense UI update)."
1853,"Another Stack Exchange site specific to Linux and Unix. They do say that most question about Android are off-topic (because they belong either at StackOverflow, or Here) but if the questions actually relate to the &quot;*nix&quot; part of Android, they are on-topic. I have also seen quite a few &quot;compiling android&quot; questions there as well. So Custom ROM Development may be able to be asked there."
1585,"For the most part, we don't need device-specific tags. They lead to overuse. It's pretty rare for an issue that someone is facing to actually be specific to their device. (People should use tags to help categorize their issue, not their device.) I've not seen evidence that there's an overabundance of questions where the distinction between the original Nexus 7 and the newer (2013) model is in anyway important. So, I say: No, we don't need a new tag, nor to rename the old one."
