341,"I much prefer a sans font, so I think that's a good choice. As for badges/tags, it'd by nice if they were similar to the standard buttons. A smaller version of  with text might serve for badges. Change the color in the center for bronze/silver/gold. The buttons here  are definitely viable for both. They gray/silver could be for normal tags, the yellow for featured tags. How about this?  It's actually an arm from the Android mascot. Perhaps not as in-your-face green, but the radius of the curve evokes Android."
823,"I think as long as it's clear you're good to do whatever you want.  Like GAThrawn I would leave the keyboard buttons for actual buttons, though I tend to use bold or nothing for them myself.  I also tend to use inline code for menu items. I suppose in an ideal world we would have a standard, or perhaps site-specific ways to indicate various Android UI elements, but I don't think it's particularly important."
1248,"The mobile site of Android Enthusiasts is pretty good. But if you really want a dedicated app, have a look at "
485,"You make a good point. I have updated the button styling a bit, both on the main site and on Meta. For the main site, I made the button text green, and for Meta they're much darker now.  The changes will be in the next deployment."
2276,"Yes, it's mainly there so that when someone tries to ask a development question, they can see the tag wiki excerpt: Development questions are off-topic. Do not ask them here. That said, if you browse that tag, you can see that there are some questions there which are about using Android as a development platform, which is OK. If your question is about using Android, it's OK, even if you're a developer or you want to use it for things related to software development. For example, there are some questions in that tag about using Android to write Python code for use on other platforms. They're relevant to our community because the same issues might come up with other text editing tasks. Obviously if the question were along the lines of ""I used my Android phone to write this Python code ... but it doesn't work. What's wrong with my code?"" that question would be off-topic, because then it's not about using Android any more."
2418,"This site is about solving issues users have with their Android devices â€“ not about seeking staff for develpoment, testing etc. So: No, you can't use this site to invite testers. As for where to do that: I'm not aware of any SE site permitting that. Some forum might be a good place; see Where can I ask questions that aren't Android Enthusiast questions?"
1058,The flag was not declined because the Mod thought that you asked the wrong question. This are two different points. A flag is always a last resort option. The answer is good as it stands and should not be deleted. IMHO there was no reason for you to flag the answer. The fact that the mod expressed concerns about your question has nothing to do with the flag being rejected. About the second point: In principle your question is good as it is. You wanted to know why there are no k9 log in the Android log. But I think that this is not a good question for Q/A sites. I think the better way would be  Android Enthusiasts is no substitution for the infrastructure provided by Android apps. (At least as long as the app provides such infrastructure.)
2148,"power tag has been burninated! Some analysis: Creating power-button should be a reasonable choice, given that there are not too many physical/hardware buttons on Android device, while it can also help categorizing the question in better scope. Possible search query to help retagging: power button is:q -[power-button] (sorted by score, exclude questions already tagged with it). If you want to participate in retagging, please ensure that the question is really asking about power button issue."
1331,"This question has been asked multiple times at Meta Stack Overflow for a variety of projects/tools/libraries. (Here's probably the definitive question and answer: Is it okay to use Stack Overflow as the support forum for a product or project? ) Part of the problem is that there's a good chunk of ""support"" that falls outside of the realm of what Android Stack Exchange is about. Feature requests, for instance. Bug reports is another. Those questions, should they get asked here, will be ruthlessly downvoted, closed, and deleted. That's not the sort of experience you want your users to have. That said, I think it's a good idea for you to let your users know that you actively monitor the tag for your app(s) here. Just don't try to make this the ""official support forum"" for it."
326,"Better to say ""not at this time"" or ""not that I have found"". Because there very well might not be an app that does what the asker wants. Maybe no one has built it. Maybe it's just not possible with the state of the OS and hardware. At least, as it currently exists. It would be better if askers described what problem they're trying to solve rather than asking for an app. There might be solutions they haven't considered. This shows up one of the problems with shopping recommendations. Personally, I have come around to thinking that ""I need an app that does X, Y, or Z"" should be closed as off-topic, while a better question would be ""How can I do X, Y and Z"". I mean, unless I have actually used an app that does exactly what they're asking for, in order to answer their question I'm just going to the Market and searching on some of their keywords. They can do that. Instead of crafting their own good search, they've finagled me into doing it for them. This site is about helping Android Enthusiasts use their devices, not helping people learn to search."
