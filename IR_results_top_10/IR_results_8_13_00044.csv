917,"The best you can really do currently is to create a new room and then invite the user to that room. You can also leave a link to the room as a comment on their post if you want. The automated chat link will also create a public room, so from that regard it's essentially the same (and you can give it whatever title you want). One downside is that the auto-inserted link will import the comments from the post into the chat room when it's created. Creating your own room beforehand will not do this, but if you are pre-emptively setting up a chat with someone then there is likely not going to be a long comment thread to import anyway, I'd imagine. This has also been discussed on Meta Stack Overflow."
867,"I'd be careful about merging the 'contacts' and 'people'. Isn't the app in HTC Sense called ""People""?  Also, 2.x and 3.x versions of Android are going to be around (and generating questions) for quite some time yet. I think Matthew Read's suggestion of creating ""contacts-app"" and ""people-app"" is a good one, although I don't think I'm in favor of making one a synonym of the other. They will at least offer a way to distinguish from questions about contacts in general."
1311,"What circumstances is a general all-round ""yes you can"" or ""no you can't"" going to be useful? Are you just going to spend days throwing random commands at your tablet in random ways, or is there something specific that you're trying to do? What are you likely to be doing that has a chance of bricking your device? A question like ""Is there a chance rooting my device using the FancyNamed Rooting Method could brick my device?"" is answerable, (and will probably already be answered on the support thread for which ever rooting method you use). Your question as it is at the moment is very broad, has a lot of unknowns, and isn't really answerable with any answer that will stay the test of time."
596,"I would tend to agree. Go ahead and start hitting that ""edit"" link. I have updated the tag-wiki for pc to direct people to more specific tags. It might help."
493,"I think a big issue is going to be finding relevant conferences. Google IO sold out in a ridiculously short time, plus I'm pretty sure they don't put out a call for speakers. AnDevCon was OK, but I was pretty disappointed in it as an advanced Android user/developer. Might need to look to some more general conferences such as MADExpo which I saw advertised on MSDN. After a conference is found, finding a speaker shouldn't be a problem: there are plenty of Android fans and developers with plenty to say."
1936,"The more appropriate close reason for the current and previous revision of the post might be ""primarily opinion based"". You could argue that one could collect statistics about which manufacturers upgrade the most often, and so on, but it's a rather complicated endeavor.  Within specific time periods and device lines you're going to find wildly different information, and none of it is useful going forward because there are simply no set-in-stone policies here.  We want questions to be useful to future readers without their answers needing to be revised all the time. Ultimately it still seems like a shopping advice question, or at least suffers from the same issues as those questions. I can't comment on the views of the other mods, but upon logging in today I found that all of them had viewed your post and declined to take action which is why I dismissed your flag."
666,"Not sure about smartphones. But there is also tablet, so maybe it makes sense to keep the smartphone tag also. I am in favor of blacklisting mobile-phones and cellphones. Matthew is right: If the phone functionality in question is calling, calls is the tag to go. And for everything else, mobile-phones and cellphones is to broad and inaccurate."
2132,"This was discussed in Is it ever acceptable to prod a user into accepting an answer? and in the posts linked there. The comment by Jeff Atwood is worth repeating: I would only remind users who have shown signs they are going to stick around. Reminding a drive-by user isn't useful. A drive-by user might have posted their question on five forums, got an answer at three, of which they read one - and it wasn't yours. Chances are they'll never be seen again, at least not from the same account. So the comments just create noise for others reading the post.  Other things to consider:"
1947,"That one seems a bit borderline to me. The reason used, ""Questions which are Android-independent...are off-topic..."" is technically correct. I'd expect that Instagram in iOS would act the same way.  But it's also not like you can go to the website and create an account; you can only create an account by installing the app. So I think the question is fine here, even if the answer is probably ""you can't""."
1734,"There's no such thing as ""WiFi charging"". Apps that purport to do this are hoaxes. If you're asking about wireless charging that might be a different matter, as there are a few devices that use the technology and it looks to become even more common. (The new Motorola 360 watch is rumored to use wireless charging.) But then, you're asking about a company who might be doing something in this arena and if you can get into their beta program. That's off-topic here. Go ask them. Frankly, I think the question was closed for the wrong reason, but it should be closed. If you have a specific question about an issue with wireless charging on your Android device, by all means add it. But the question you ask is either vague and speculative or not really about Android and is likely to be outdated and useless relatively quickly."
