1516,"This is quite possibly my fault (though the system should probably handle it better). At the end of last week How do you link to applications in the Android market? came up in my Close Votes queue as a dupe of How to post a link to an android market app? but after looking at the two questions, it was obvious that one had old, out-of-date and (now-)incorrect answers (one answer was by me) whereas the other one had answers that are current and correct. In my opinion the Close As Dupe vote had been cast on the wrong question (based on which one had the currently good answers) so I ""Leave Open"" voted the one and I submitted the first VtC on the other. Having explained what I did though, the system really should show what's going on in a clearer manner, and handle the situation where one is Closed as a Dupe while the other is still in the vote to close phase."
2488,"Depends on what kind of flag – and then how active the ""workers"" on the corresponding queue are. You wrote you flagged a question off-topic: if that was done via ""vote-to-close"" it ends up in the ""community review queue"", waiting for 4 more community members to agree – or disagree. Depending on that, when 5 close-votes (or less but a mod throwing the final one) have accumulated, the question is closed. As you mention your flag having been ""declined"", that rather sounds like you've flagged it for mod attention. Then it was most likely declined as it (no longer) matched, as you assumed. Talking about mod flags: No, usually not. We (mods) might decide the flag is invalid – but we usually check if it was raised in good confidence; in which case we ""dismiss"" it as ""helpful"". If you indeed marked it for mod attention: better ""vote to close"" for being off-topic (no need to raise it for a mod, our community can deal with it fine – and we mods are participating in that as well). If instead you raised a ""regular flag"" (i.e. used the ""close"" link – unlikely, as you'd need a little more rep for that), please clarify. I'm not aware of ""declining"" in that context – after all, those are not really ""flags"" but rather ""votes"" (hence ""vote to close"", not ""flag to close""). Also note you can always retract such a vote. That said, thanks for bringing it up – last but not least as a reminder for us mods to better look twice before deciding to ""decline"" a flag!"
2225,"This site is for Android users.  As a rule of thumb, do not ask any question where the question does not come from the perspective of an end user doing end user things. Marketing and charging money are obviously related, but are distinct concepts; you can do one without the other.  So whether your app is free is not relevant, and asking for feedback absolutely counts as ""market research"". As Eldarerathis notes, we also do not accept open-ended polling or anything of that kind.  Questions should be specific and should require answers that can be determined to be correct or not &mdash; not just an opinion, like feedback."
930,"I've kept an eye on this question to see if the community (via voting, commenting, or answering) held any kind of meaningful opinion on this topic, but since the activity here has been relatively flat I'm going to go ahead and add my thoughts. Please understand that this is solely my opinion on the matter. The one concern I have with questions of this nature is where factual data would be coming from. Since the app in question is closed-source any truly helpful answer is going to require either: Because of the nature of proprietary software, any answer that does not involve #1 or #2 is almost certainly going to be speculation or an educated guess. It could very well be an accurate educated guess, but there would be effectively no way for anyone to verify it as such, so the voting largely becomes a matter of ""Yeah, that sounds reasonable"" or ""No, that sounds ridiculous"". On the other hand, I completely understand your motivation and I appreciate the amount of effort and pre-question research you've clearly put into your question. Also, please don't construe my thoughts above as an indication that I think only trivial questions are appropriate for this site - that is certainly not the case at all. Further complicating this is the fact that I do recognize that it is inherently difficult to determine if either points #1 or #2 that I've noted can be met on any given question. So I suppose a related and slightly more general question could be: Is the answerability of question an acceptable metric for moderation, or no? If so, how do we make that determination? If not, at what point to we draw the line on questions that will attract and/or encourage speculative answers? From what I can tell (and correct me if I'm wrong, anyone) that seems to be the crux of the issue here."
792,"I am very unlikely to root my device, so I don't really have any skin in this game. That said, I do believe the current canonical question is getting too big and unwieldy. I think ""How do I root device X"" or, even better, ""How do I root Y class of devices"" is a good way to go. I'm concerned, though, about the different ways one can root a device. I would caution against ANY ""how do I root device X with method Y"" questions. I also agree with Flow in that these shouldn't automatically go to Community Wiki. It will take work to put this information together; the people who do should get the reward. We also have a slew of closed questions that can be re-opened and answered. That should make the askers happy. (Although that's not a reason to do this.)"
359,"I don't think I've yet seen a question closed that didn't have a legitimate reason to be closed. If you feel like many of your questions are being closed then you might just want to re-read the FAQ and some of the Meta topics so that you know what is considered appropriate for AE and what is not. Closing questions is an important part of keeping the site clean and organized, and isn't necessarily a bad sign, but an indicator that the higher-rep users are involved. I would also say that we get a large number of development questions due to the word ""Android"" in the title of the site, and they are all subsequently closed and moved to SO. I have no data to go along with that statement, but it seems to happen pretty frequently. When the site is in beta there is a lot of onus on the high-rep users and mods to make sure that the rules are enforced, since it's a time period that will define the site later on down the road. Perhaps this encourages people to use their votes, but again, I don't (personally) feel that any questions are being closed without reasonable cause. That being said, I also only see one closed question on your account on AE, though perhaps you have others that were deleted which I cannot view. The one that I can still see was very clearly 1) A shopping recommendation, which is decidedly off-topic and 2) A fairly subjective comparison of two devices."
917,"The best you can really do currently is to create a new room and then invite the user to that room. You can also leave a link to the room as a comment on their post if you want. The automated chat link will also create a public room, so from that regard it's essentially the same (and you can give it whatever title you want). One downside is that the auto-inserted link will import the comments from the post into the chat room when it's created. Creating your own room beforehand will not do this, but if you are pre-emptively setting up a chat with someone then there is likely not going to be a long comment thread to import anyway, I'd imagine. This has also been discussed on Meta Stack Overflow."
1501,"The short answer, of course, is that you can't expect decisions made by humans to be consistent. The longer answer is that what's off-topic and on-topic is not determined by one user's comment on a question, but by the democratic process of voting to close. On a wider scale, discussion here on meta sets a written policy for what is on- and off-topic, and it's then down to individual users and moderators to decide each question. App recommendations and other kinds of ""shopping advice"" are off-topic because they're often opinion-based and subjective. Sometimes the only objectively correct answer can be the list of search results from Google Play: but this is only correct until someone releases a new app, or discontinues an old one. Questions where you have a specific problem to solve - one that you can't easily search for in Google Play - are on-topic even if the answer happens to be ""such-and-such app can do that"". Different users and moderators draw the line between those two kinds of question in different places. Some users are very quick on the trigger, and close any question that includes, ""Is there an app that can do this?"" to encourage the questioner to think more about the problem he's trying to solve (and to edit the question accordingly). Some users are more inclined to look to the underlying problem and ignore the exact wording of the question. Of course, because the decisions are made by the community, whether a borderline question is closed or not depends on who voted that time, and maybe even on what mood they were in that day or how well they understood what the question really meant. Requiring five votes to close a question smooths out the inconsistencies somewhat, but it's still easy to find pairs of similar questions where one was closed and one wasn't."
1812,"All the close reasons count as one ""type of flag"" for this purpose. If you've VTC'ed or flagged with a close reason, you can't VTC or flag again with a close reason, even if it's a different reason. The spam and offensive flags work in the same way: if you've flagged as spam, you can't also flag as offensive, but you can still VTC or flag with a close reason."
1717,"I think this kind of question is very close to others we've had about enterprise-style deployment of Android devices in businesses and schools. We don't have the right kind of users on the site to give good answers yet, but if we keep getting these questions, the experts will find us soon enough."
