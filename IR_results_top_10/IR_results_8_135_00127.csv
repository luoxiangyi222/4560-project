1654,"From your screenshot, it looks like you've hit the font selection problem with the Roboto font. If you install Roboto under Linux, then when a site or program asks for Roboto, it gets ""Roboto Medium"" (which is quite heavyweight) instead of ""Roboto Regular"" (which looks normal). This is a problem with how the weights are set in the font files. This site has an explanation of how to change your font configuration to avoid the problem. Once you've added the workaround you'll notice that ASE looks a lot 'lighter' in font terms, and much easier on the eye."
913,"You know, I actually think I tried to suggest this a few weeks back but I didn't meet the criteria for suggesting the synonym at the time (and then forgot about it). In any case, agreed and done."
349,"You probably had a reputation re-calc. The number on your profile doesn't change immediately when a question or answer (where you had upvotes/downvotes) is deleted. I do know that a number of old, closed, off-topic questions were deleted recently."
872,"Unfortunately, the name ""Android Enthusiasts"" is so close to generic that it's very unlikely we'd be able to stop them from using it. However, our wonderful core developers have told me it's pretty easy to make that hyperlink in the Google results say ""Android Enthusiasts - Stack Exchange"" rather than ""Android - Stack Exchange,"" so that change will be implemented soon. If you're looking to become their friends, maybe a representative from this site could join one of their future hangouts as a special guest? Just a suggestion; interact or don't interact with them as you wish. :) As Matthew Read pointed out, this site is the top Google hit when searching ""Android Enthusiasts"" so there's nothing to worry about right now. They probably just didn't know this site exists and already uses the name they decided to adopt a week ago."
2323,"What's the intent of OP? ...Changing the date and time in the phone can ""evade"" the version and trial and continue to use it Further, they want to know .... if it was possible to change the date of a single app even by changing the source code of 'App To my mind, there is no ambiguity around that Is it legal ? - we are not equipped to discuss Is it ethical ? To me clearly, NO Could OP have other valid reasons for asking , which might have triggered this question ? - possible,  but if not stated, let's not assume either ways but go by what's presented ( also note that there was no response to my first comment, stating that it is unethical ) Should we permit such questions (not withstanding the fact that a diligent search on Internet would reveal ways and means ) ?? Emphatic NO"
962,"No, no policy on the links. That's just a function of people pasting the URL from their browser. I'd wager most people don't even know that ""hl=x"" is supposed to be a language hint. (And the rest that do don't notice it.) So long as the link works without it I don't see a reason why removing it would be a bad thing. It might be too minor if that's all you're looking to change, though."
2322,"As long as it does not violate any existing law (tricking with date/time , AFAIK, does not violate any) in applicable countries, we should be welcome to discuss. As per my answer, such tools does exist. That trick does not involve any cracking or reverse engineering. It makes no difference (to that specific app) from changing the global time of my device. Then why global but not to only one app? What if the OP did not mention ""trial period"" at all? What if the OP wants to test an alarm app or Trigger's timed event? It's wrong to judge that ""because your intention is unethical, your goal/objective is also wrong"" (and closing the question). As said above, the answer may be useful to someone looking for a way to test an alarm app. I agree that such questions should be closed: How can I bypass the trial period? How can I get the full version for free? ... but not these: I know setting a fake time can bypass the trial. How can I set it? Placing this key file grants me the full version. How can I move this file to the desired place? I already have it in my SD card. Let me repeat: It's not hacking. It's unlike Freedom or Lucky Patcher. I agree that F/LP should be OT here for illegitimacy (referencing Stack Overflow's opinion)."
2370,"Not a full solution, but at least a work-around: put the term in ""double quotes"" when searching. Got me 5 hits, only two of them were ""wrong"" because the writers forgot the apostrophe (""Navigate to chromes profile directory …"", ""I cleared chromes data…"") – which is correct as per the search terms. Afraid not much that we can do about the ""related questions"" – nor for new users even if they use the search."
1730,"I think most savvy users already know better than to run software that's only available as a download from a file-sharing site such as Mediafire, so TBH I wouldn't include such a link at all. If you have to link to an official ROM, then link to the source on the manufacturer's site or equivalent. If you have to link to some other software, link to the distributor's website, or to the relevant XDA Developers page. That has several advantages.  Users can have some confidence about what software they're downloading, and whether it's been tampered with or contains malware On a site like XDA Developers, people discuss the software in question, so visitors can find out more information, and whether the software can be relied on, by looking at other people's comments there. If the distribution method of the software changes, the original page will update their links, so visitors can still get the file without anything on this site having to change. The idea of avoiding link-only answers isn't only to avoid broken links: that reason's quoted most because it's easier to understand. The other reason is that a link-only answer doesn't tell the user what to expect at the other end. Linking to some random file on Mediafire has just the same problem: I don't know whether I'm getting genuine, working software, or a trojan. Linking to an official source or another reputable site lets me know what to expect, making your answer more useful to everyone."
2397,"Related question Adding a template question to the Ask Question box. Perhaps such changes are not possible unless it's a global change across all SE sites Questions having the phrase I am working on app or similar need not be developer oriented. That could be the reason for asking but the question may not be off topic. For instance, in this question , if OP had said he was developing an app for that device and wanted to know the path, it wouldn't make it off topic Copy full system and data partitions of Oneplus 3T to computer or a better example How can I do development on my Android device? OP's are expected to search for relevant tags and if their question is related to development use development and if they bother to read to read the tag wiki , they would know not to ask (too much to expect, going by experience). See Does [tag:development] mean &quot;Asking for closure&quot;? I fully endorse that questions having code should raise a flag but it is related to the first bullet point and would like this to be implemented ASAP. Perhaps , moderators here could take this up Edit: Discovered this question on Meta.SE asked years before Revisiting question templates"
