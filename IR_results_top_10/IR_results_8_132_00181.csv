1579,"I second Matthew's thoughts: we do need to do something for this situation. We still get a lot of ""Can I install 4.2 on my $phone?"" questions, and at the moment the only alternative course of action is to answer them all individually (if anyone bothers answering them). I for one wouldn't be sorry to see the ""When will my device get..."" questions go: they're necessarily going to be incomplete, and they're a time sink to keep up-to-date. But the second half of your question, the part you haven't set in bold, the part no one is answering; that's the important part. How else should we handle the inevitable ""When will {name of device} get Android {version}?"" questions? If someone proposes an alternative, we can debate it. I'm afraid I have no ideas, and it looks like no one else does either."
1387,"I say no. ""Unknown sources"" is (should be) about the setting. ""Sideloading"" is (should be) about the act of installing an app outside of the context of the Market/Play Store/etc. They are related, sure, but I don't think they're the same."
475,"Sure. There are plenty of great topics for blog posts that can hopefully go far above and beyond being a mere reference answer for common questions If this gets traction, coordinate with rebecca@stackexchange.com and she can get a provisional blog set up."
822,"I normally save the &lt; kbd > tags for actual hardware buttons (or at least buttons that are normally hardware even if they're sometimes soft) like Power, Menu, Home, Back, etc. For menu options and clicking on items on the screen I'd normally either bold them (or for long options like descriptions on tick boxes ""enclose them in quotes"". So for your example I'd say Settings -> About phone -> Android version Or Settings -> Display -> tick ""Auto-rotate screen"" Or giving a Xoom the ""three-fingered salute"" would be hold down Power + Volume Up at the same time."
841,"I think you're seeing one of two behaviours that changed recently with @replies. Essentially the @reply isn't auto-completed (and is often removed when you post) if there is only one possible, unmistakable person who's the target of your post and so your @name bit would be redundant. So if you're making a comment on a question that has no answers, and it's the very first comment, then you are obviously making a comment to the questioner, so adding @name is redundant. The other thing that's changed is that when SE thinks that two people are having a conversation (when there's only two of you commenting and you're going back and forth between you) then the @name is removed too, as it's obvious who you're talking to. In these cases even though there's no @name in your comment, because it's obvious who you're talking to the person that you're talking to will still get notified that you're talking to them (for instance question askers are always notified when someone comments on their question with @naming anyone else)."
41,"I would say yes. Certainly for built-in and Google applications. For more obscure application maybe not, but those are less likely to get answers anyways"
2395,"If you have a better answer, post it. Explain what should and should not be done, and why. Downvote any wrong answers you see. Comment on their flaws when applicable. But don't try to change someone else's answer to say what they did not intend to say. Respect the original author even while disagreeing with them.  Contrary to your claim, there are many dangerously wrong answers on other sites, such as Stack Overflow. Following someone's wrong advice regarding information security can be much worse than destroying a phone. Those answers still exist. When there's is a dangerous misconception around, it's better for it to be voiced and refuted than never be voiced."
81,"My two cents: The dessert names of the versions is fun and all, but most of your normal users aren't going to have a clue as to what it means. Further, it doesn't appear on the phone, while the version number does. So, at best, our dessert names should only be synonyms. I wonder if the naked [2.2] isn't a bit too esoteric. But, then [android 2.2] and [version 2.2] are redundant if clearer. (The former also has the added benefit that if there were a merger in the future, or Android forked into multiple product paths, no global renames would be required. That's probably not something we should be worrying about, though.) So, I say [&lt;version number&gt;], with [&lt;dessert codename&gt;] and [android-&lt;version number&gt;] as synonyms. Update: The community isn't playing along. android-2.2 x 50 2.2-froyo x 24 froyo x 6 2.2 x 1 1.5-cupcake x 3 android-1.5 x 2 android-2.1 x 34 2.1-eclair x 8 2.5-gingerbread x 1 (which is just plain wrong; everything I've seen indicates Gingerbread will be 3.0, except for this, which implies that Gingerbread might be 2.3) I still stand by my suggestion of raw version numbers (e.g., 2.2) as best, with tags in the style of android-2.2 as second best. Not everyone knows about the dessert names, and if Google stops naming their versions that way it's not going to make any sense. Tags based on the official names is more future-proof."
703,Q: Is it possible to set a HTML signature in the Android Gmail app? (Nov 2011)
860,This if fine by me. Martin covers all the points I was going to say. Pass on over the good questions. :)
