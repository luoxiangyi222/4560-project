1915,"Two things I'd mention: The primary top-left android logo is too similar in colour to the background The Ask Question button could be highlighted, Ã  la a floating action button, in a different colour and slightly raised."
238,"Sounds like something that would be quite useful. If it were one App per Answer, then each app could be individually voted up/down as well as comments left against it...so each answer in itself is useful..."
1549,"If you don't take any time to learn anything about the site you're visiting, it's not going to work for you.  Start here. We're not obligated to help you, and we are a community-led site.  Driveby comments that can be left by anyone are not in our best interest.  You will notice that you don't even need to sign up to post a question or answer, however. Without knowing what question you're referring to or what your comment would be, it's hard to help you further."
1192," Liam W answered:  Comments - to notify that user to try and improve. If I understand what they are on about, the edit button. If after a while, nothing has changed, the close or delete button.  Flow answered:  Edit, downvote or flag. More or less in that order  Suraj Bajaj answered:  Depends. If poorly written, edit button would be my first choice. If argumentative, I would prefer leaving a comment. Down vote would always be my last choice. I would rather try to improve (and ask the author to improve), than just down voting. However, last choice is still a choice! :)"
1053,"If there are tag slots left, tag it with browser and chrome-for-android. If there are no slots left, just use chrome-for-android. I saw some edits here that removed the ""parent tags"". E.g. if something was tagged with usb, tethering usb-tethering, somethingelse usb and tethering was removed. IMHO this is counterproductive. As long as the removed tags are not replaced with some better/important tag(s), just leave it as it is."
1900,"Accounts are temporarily blocked from suggesting edits if too many of their suggested edits are rejected by reviewers. The block lasts for 7 days, and the error message used to tell you how many days were left, but I do not know if it still does. In any case, your account will be allowed to suggest edits once again in 5 more days. In the meantime, I would recommend that you take a look at some of your recent edits and note the reasons given for the ones that were rejected. As specific guidance, the problematic edits that I see appear to:"
1066,"I am undecided. This are two different things, although there are  very few  questions. I would let them separated for a while and see how things go."
823,"I think as long as it's clear you're good to do whatever you want.  Like GAThrawn I would leave the keyboard buttons for actual buttons, though I tend to use bold or nothing for them myself.  I also tend to use inline code for menu items. I suppose in an ideal world we would have a standard, or perhaps site-specific ways to indicate various Android UI elements, but I don't think it's particularly important."
2533,"I'd start with this: ... as the problem at hand has been fixed ... Yes, if you solved a problem yourself, you're always encouraged to post a self-answer (and accept it if appropriate). The goal of Stack Exchange is to build a library of knowledge to help not only the question asker, but more importantly, all future visitors to the sites. Therefore any potentially useful question and solution (answer) should not be left out just because no one cares at present. It's meant to be valuable to the future. On the other hand, neither option 2 nor option 3 would be appropriate, as the question is of a decent shape and doesn't warrant closure or deletion. Option 1 may be acceptable, but why would you ignore it when there are better options available? :) Congrats on your first self-answer then!  This answer probably looks like an expanded version of Izzy's comment, but I believe that it'd be because this is the general feeling or consensus that the Android Enthusiasts Stack Exchange community would have."
