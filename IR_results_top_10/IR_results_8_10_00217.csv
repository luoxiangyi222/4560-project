1432,"I don't see how questions as in your examples could be off topic. All of them fit the scope as defined in our FAQ. None of them matches the kind of questions mentioned as explicitly off topic or ""not to be asked"". Question 2 &amp; 3 should be perfectly fine, and I can find no argument defining them off topic. With question 1 one could argue it might be a XY problem, so here it might be a question of phrasing and interpretation: is it the problem you want to solve (and Tasker being your proposed solution) -- or is your question rather to understand how one could use Tasker in this context. The latter, again, should be perfectly fine."
1906,"Overall I like the new theme. Feels much fresher. A couple of things I'd like to mention: status-completed Adding images to posts doesn't seem to be working for me now. The transparent gray overlay appears on top of the modal. Trying to click the dialog instead causes a click on the transparent layer, which dismisses the dialog. This is Chrome 41, Windows 7. The below images were added by editing a post on a different site and copying the links over here.  status-completed The icon in the SE menu is different from the favicon. Is there a plan to make these the same? I like the favicon much better, personally:  Speaking of icons, the one in the header logo on the main site is very faint. I actually like it better in green, because right now you can barely see it due to the lack of contrast. I understand if this may have been a deliberate choice, but I personally think it looks odd. Excuse my poor Paint.NET skills on this one, but here's a kind of general comparison.

324,"Often you can find other sources (even if just forum posts, etc) supporting the assertion that no app for ABC exists or, better still, posts explaining why it is not (currently) possible if there is some technical block to having such an app. Where you can cite this kind of supporting evidence, I would think you are better placed to provide a genuine answer. Without any supporting evidence, where the answer really is just ""I can't find one"", then my preference would be for a comment."

77,There are now several people is one lonely guy with 1000+ reputation. (Didn't we get temporary mods?) This is probably no longer necessary.
1834,Sure. This is one of the topics we actually define specifically as on-topic on our Help Center: If your question generally covers... then this is the right place to ask. 
1501,"The short answer, of course, is that you can't expect decisions made by humans to be consistent. The longer answer is that what's off-topic and on-topic is not determined by one user's comment on a question, but by the democratic process of voting to close. On a wider scale, discussion here on meta sets a written policy for what is on- and off-topic, and it's then down to individual users and moderators to decide each question. App recommendations and other kinds of ""shopping advice"" are off-topic because they're often opinion-based and subjective. Sometimes the only objectively correct answer can be the list of search results from Google Play: but this is only correct until someone releases a new app, or discontinues an old one. Questions where you have a specific problem to solve - one that you can't easily search for in Google Play - are on-topic even if the answer happens to be ""such-and-such app can do that"". Different users and moderators draw the line between those two kinds of question in different places. Some users are very quick on the trigger, and close any question that includes, ""Is there an app that can do this?"" to encourage the questioner to think more about the problem he's trying to solve (and to edit the question accordingly). Some users are more inclined to look to the underlying problem and ignore the exact wording of the question. Of course, because the decisions are made by the community, whether a borderline question is closed or not depends on who voted that time, and maybe even on what mood they were in that day or how well they understood what the question really meant. Requiring five votes to close a question smooths out the inconsistencies somewhat, but it's still easy to find pairs of similar questions where one was closed and one wasn't."
517,I do not know the ins-and-outs of the automated quality filters that are in place. I suspect that the lack of capital letters might be one of the triggers. You don't mention the title you were trying to use; if it was identical to your question text that would be an easy filter to put into place. You would do well to try some of the suggestions in the answers to the two questions eldarerathis linked to.
2393,"I have one question. Should questions about ""How to root X"" without a clear answer, or with at least one clear answer stating the device is not rootable and no valid rooting method provided in another answer, be added to the list? The list says ""How do I root my device"", so I doubt the usefulness of questions without clear answers and models stated to be non-rootable (at the moment)."
