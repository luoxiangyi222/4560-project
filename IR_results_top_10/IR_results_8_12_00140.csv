1333,"Minor edits should come with added value, like rephrasing the sentences or titles so that they are clearer or easier to understand, adding formatting, or editing the tags where applicable. Minor wrong spellings are where we need to think twice on editing. Sometimes, they are  forgivable, sometimes not. But removing ""thanks"" and ""regards"" alone is TOO minor. As for gaming the system, I agree with the others. These points are too small to be an issue. If this was the motivation alone, then it's not worth the effort. Better things can be done with people's time. So, we should appreciate these types of users who are active in keeping the community clean. [You would want this kind off community in Foursquare] Although we have enough moderators and high-rep members who can do these tasks better, these types of users are better off working on more important moderating tasks. At the end, though, we should strive to make things easier to read / understand."
1812,"All the close reasons count as one ""type of flag"" for this purpose. If you've VTC'ed or flagged with a close reason, you can't VTC or flag again with a close reason, even if it's a different reason. The spam and offensive flags work in the same way: if you've flagged as spam, you can't also flag as offensive, but you can still VTC or flag with a close reason."
1973,"After discussing with two to three people and posting this type of question, I found that  No one has any objection on these type of question.  Since it is not possible for all to know about the file standard of android these type of questions will be helpful for people like me. I wanted to know where the saved wifi-passwords are stored and I got an answer from this SE site and therefore I wanted to know about the other files stores in same directory as that of the file which contained the saved wifi passwords.  So this type of questions can be helpful this way. Best Regards, Jasser"
796,"The problem here is that question's topic doesn't have anywhere currently that it would belong within the StackExchange network. For Android.SE, the relevant section of our FAQ is: What kind of questions can I ask here? Please note the following topics are expressly off-topic here: It's the last (of my quoted) bullet points that's important. This site is for users of Android, the question was about publishing an app in the Market, that's not a user topic. Discussions on these parts of the FAQ are primarily here FAQ: “What kind of questions should I ask here?” and FAQ: “What kind of questions should I NOT ask here?” As for StackOverflow, their FAQ says: Frequently Asked Questions What kind of questions can I ask here? Stack Overflow is for professional and enthusiast programmers, people
who write code because they love it. We feel the best Stack Overflow
questions have a bit of source code in them, but if your question
generally covers … This question isn't covered by any of those question types, so they're not going to accept the question if it's migrated back. Arguably they should never have migrated it here, but just closed it there, but not every mod knows the exact scope of every other site and mistakes are unfortunately made. There is a proposal on the Are 51 site to create a StackExchange site dedicated to App Stores, if that proposal gets enough support, and the site is created, then that would be the natural home for this question. Until that day, it appears that unfortunately there is currently no good home for the question."
1121,I just want to add to Matthew's answer that I think that the confusion comes with the fact that it's hard for the average user to distinguish between an Activity and a Service running in background. We have two questions Both a very similar. Yet there are not really exact duplicates. That is why my solution would be to reopen the first question of type 2 and close either this one or Scott's question as duplicate and merge the answer(s).

2457,"Thanks a lot Dan for your work as a Moderator and as a learned and a trusted user of this site. While I find your answers truly insightful and inspiring (one of those answers which actually inspired me to start contributing to this site), I equally appreciate your work as a Moderator.  I was one of the candidates running up for elections back in 2016, and while I lost and kind of felt bad because I lost to you (a momentary emotion, usual to mortals; and Izzy was sure to win anyway, so I was competing with you mostly :D), I gradually realized that the community chose a much better person as a Moderator than what I could be back than.  You brought to the table the kind of patience as a Moderator I didn't know  in person. (I think I failed to witness that in other Mods before 2016 was mostly because earlier the Mods were understaffed and under heavy janitorial work load so exercising that much patience might have been detrimental to the site, so they did what they thought was best for the site which I appreciate equally).  You started salvaging those borderline developer-cum-end-user oriented questions which I et al hastily thought would be closed as off-topic. One of the distinct trait I noted was that you often let the community decide what to do with questions which introduced ambiguity when deciding the scope of the concerned questions.  Furthermore, unless somebody else responded first, you (Izzy too) always remained in site's room, welcomed the visitors as a host and guided them gently. My personal interaction with you further strengthened my respect for you as a Moderator, especially when I brought to Mods' concern issues which were somewhat unhealthy to the community, and which sometimes I brought with emotions leading to indiscreet engagement. But, you always exercised that basic trait of a Moderator to remain cool, see the facts as it is, and never misuse or abuse the power no matter if it solves the problem in the short run.   I'm not good with memory so that's what I could recall. That been said, thank you again Dan for helping us fellow users, along with our other hard working Moderators, to focus on that which matters most to us (asking quality questions and answering insightful answers)"
2325,"I should point out a situation here. If an app has some kind of hidden spyware, bloatware, or malicious virus of some kind, cracking the particular app to figure out how to stop it and cure phones of it (especially if its hijacked the phone in some way) may be one of the most ethical things you -could- do in relation to you interacting with apps. That said, I would say attempts to force a certain ethical judgement may actually be unethical from that viewpoint. "
2228,"It's worth considering the type of answer that one will expect to receive. On a development forum like SO, one will likely receive a very technical response.
On a softer (is that the right word to use) forum one will likely receive a less hard-core techie response. Thus, there is merit in having this cross over and even an argument for identical questions on both forums as they'll be asking them in different contexts."
1906,"Overall I like the new theme. Feels much fresher. A couple of things I'd like to mention: status-completed Adding images to posts doesn't seem to be working for me now. The transparent gray overlay appears on top of the modal. Trying to click the dialog instead causes a click on the transparent layer, which dismisses the dialog. This is Chrome 41, Windows 7. The below images were added by editing a post on a different site and copying the links over here.  status-completed The icon in the SE menu is different from the favicon. Is there a plan to make these the same? I like the favicon much better, personally:  Speaking of icons, the one in the header logo on the main site is very faint. I actually like it better in green, because right now you can barely see it due to the lack of contrast. I understand if this may have been a deliberate choice, but I personally think it looks odd. Excuse my poor Paint.NET skills on this one, but here's a kind of general comparison.
