1947,"That one seems a bit borderline to me. The reason used, ""Questions which are Android-independent...are off-topic..."" is technically correct. I'd expect that Instagram in iOS would act the same way.  But it's also not like you can go to the website and create an account; you can only create an account by installing the app. So I think the question is fine here, even if the answer is probably ""you can't""."
1365,"Done.  I'm going to double check right now for any ""remote access"" questions that might need to be retagged. Edit: remote-control and remote-access are still a bit messy.  I'm not sure if we should merge them or what.  I don't think there are many questions about using devices as TV remotes so fortunately that isn't complicating things :)"
606,"I've thought about this some more, and I think we had a bit of a shift after the site went public.  Though I won't point them out, there were a few highly active users I can think of who largely disappeared after that. I'm not sure why that happened, but I do wonder if it's related to the rep requirements suddenly doubling.  I was about to hit 10k rep then (Trusted User) and it was a bit of a shock when I realized I was going to have to duplicate my entire performance so far just in order to get back where I was before, since now Trusted User is 20k rep. That must have been immensely discouraging for some users.  Maybe now we're just waiting for new users to come up and fill the middle tier that was suddenly vacated by the change in rep requirements? I'm not sure it makes sense to have the same rep requirements as a huge site like SO either.  I would happily trust GAThrawn or eldarerathis, for example, with the 10k tools.  Their work flagging and close-voting is immensely useful and they have great judgment.  We don't require mods to have 20k rep before making them mods, right?  I'm the only one over 20k and I just got there recently! Maybe we already have a middle class, and we're just not making effective use of them."
2144,"I agree that power is a bit uninformative. I'm not yet convinced that making it a synonym for power-on is the right thing in the long term. While a lot of existing uses of power are about startup, there are a lot more about the power button. If those questions start being tagged with power-on, then that tag will become as useless as power is now. Maybe we need a new power-button tag."
535,"The first three questions kind of use it sensibly: Those are clearly questions about different versions of Android in a general sense. That said, I don't think the tag is useful, and it's certainly been abused.  It doesn't create a useful category; I don't think filtering for these questions would be a common behavior."
1914,"I reopened the question.  I agree with you that it was just a bit unclear but does seem to be about using an old kernel with a new ROM, which is fully within our purview.  If the user wants to know how to create a custom ROM based on that it would be of-topic, but we give the benefit of the doubt. Do note that closure is intended to be a temporary state before either deletion or editing and reopening (which is why it now says ""on hold"").  Quick closure is generally a good thing since it decreases a post's visibility a bit, so it won't gather downvotes while it's being improved and doesn't gather answers focused on the wrong thing.  It is always fully reversible and editing a closed question always nominates it for re-opening."
818,We definitely can't reproduce this. Did you try disabling any Chrome extensions you are using? Did you modify any of the default browser settings?
923,"I went ahead and renamed stock-ui to vanilla-ui. I've also updated the tag wiki and the handful of questions that were using the old tag to use the correct terminology. There did not appear to be any questions that were using stock-ui to actually refer to a ""stock"" (manufacturer default) interface, so the tag is unused at this point."
526,"I'll never use +1, just like I never use StumbleUpon or the Facebook ""likes"".  That said, other people will.  I see no reason not too, really.  Even if it dies in the future, it's probably not much work to integrate it (the SE people or Al can correct me on this if I'm wrong)."
1484,"Topics related to users using the Play Store and problems using the Play Store are already on topic, there's lots of them in the google-play-store tag. It's just questions from a developer's perspective that are off-topic, and I think that's still the right distinction."
